### Gen Z Isn't Lazy --- The System Changed, and We Pretended It Didn't {#4e3c .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading .graf--title name="4e3c"}

Gen Z isn't wrong when they say they don't want to work. That sentence
alone is enough to trigger outrage across LinkedIn, dinner tables, and
WhatsApp family groups. It sounds irresponsible. It sounds entitled. It
sounds like a generation refusing to grow up.

But if you pause for a moment and actually examine the world Gen Z
inherited, the picture changes completely.

This generation did not wake up one day and collectively decide that
ambition is overrated. They looked at the math. They compared effort
versus reward. And they realized something uncomfortable: the rules
their parents played by no longer exist.

This blog is not an emotional rant. It is an honest examination of
reality --- from three lenses:

- [A **founder's perspective**]{#a70d}
- [A **cybersecurity professional's perspective**]{#e50c}
- [And the **Gen Z perspective itself**]{#fe51}

Only when we look at all three do we understand why Gen Z's frustration
is not rebellion --- it is rational response.

### The World Our Parents Entered {#a9a4 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="a9a4"}

Our parents stepped into a very different economic and professional
ecosystem.

Many of them walked into offices with handwritten resumes. No ATS
filters. No LinkedIn optimization. No aptitude rounds, coding
challenges, or behavioral interviews.

A degree was rare, valuable, and respected.

A job was not just employment --- it was stability.

With one salary:

- [A family could be supported]{#ee28}
- [A house could be purchased by the mid-30s]{#924e}
- [Children could be educated]{#2f3f}
- [Healthcare, though imperfect, was manageable]{#aafa}

They worked around 40 hours a week. Work usually stayed at work.
Evenings belonged to family. Weekends belonged to rest.

Retirement was not a fantasy. It was a phase of life.

This wasn't because our parents were smarter or worked harder.

It was because the system rewarded effort predictably.

### The World Gen Z Walked Into {#ebd9 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="ebd9"}

Gen Z entered a completely different battlefield.

They were told the same script:

- [Study hard]{#01e2}
- [Get a degree]{#4b92}
- [Get a job]{#afc1}
- [Build a life]{#ed36}

But the outcome changed while the advice stayed the same.

Today, a fresher job opening attracts:

- [5,000 to 10,000 applicants]{#f003}
- [Requires 2--3 years of experience]{#a70b}
- [Offers a CTC of ₹3--4 lakh]{#e582}

At the same time, students spend:

- [₹5--10 lakhs on private degrees]{#78f9}
- [Years preparing for competitive exams]{#587d}
- [Additional money on certifications just to stay "relevant"]{#0992}

Housing prices that once stood at ₹15--20 lakhs now cross ₹2--3 crore.

Healthcare is expensive.

Education loans follow people into their 30s.

Work hours have expanded quietly:

- [Slack after office hours]{#6052}
- [Emails on weekends]{#5a5c}
- ["Urgent" calls at night]{#6812}

This isn't laziness. This is arithmetic.

### Founder Perspective: Why the Old Employment Model Is Breaking {#a439 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="a439"}

As a [founder](https://vijaykumargupta.in/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://vijaykumargupta.in/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank"}, I've hired people, fired people, built teams, and
watched markets shift.

The truth founders rarely say out loud is this:

**Most businesses today cannot offer the stability our parents
had --- even if they want to.**

### The Economics Have Changed {#5300 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="5300"}

Margins are thinner.

Competition is global.

Automation replaces entry-level work faster than companies can redesign
roles.

Investors demand growth, not loyalty.

In such an environment:

- [Long-term employment becomes risky]{#08fc}
- [Training freshers becomes expensive]{#bdec}
- [Retention becomes uncertain]{#8cd6}

Founders respond by:

- [Hiring laterally instead of training]{#ad9e}
- [Demanding "ready-made" talent]{#0a3d}
- [Offering lower pay but higher expectations]{#74d9}

This creates a paradox:

> *Companies need skilled people, but don't want to invest in building
> them.*

Gen Z didn't create this problem. They are reacting to it.

### Why Gen Z Questions Hustle Culture {#6472 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="6472"}

From a founder's seat, hustle makes sense --- survival depends on it.

But Gen Z watched:

- [Founders glorify 80-hour weeks]{#8c63}
- [Employees burn out quietly]{#8343}
- [Loyalty rewarded with layoffs]{#aa33}

They learned early that:

- [Overwork doesn't guarantee security]{#3887}
- [Passion doesn't guarantee protection]{#cf1b}

So they ask better questions:

- [Why should I sacrifice health for a role that can replace me?]{#fe79}
- [Why should identity be tied to a company?]{#93be}

These aren't rebellious questions. They're intelligent ones.

### Cybersecurity Professional Perspective: A Front-Row Seat to Burnout {#dcbc .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="dcbc"}

[Cybersecurity](https://einitial24.com/category/cybersecurity/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://einitial24.com/category/cybersecurity/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} is often portrayed as a "safe" career.

High demand. Good salaries. Job security.

The reality is far more complex.

### The Illusion of Opportunity {#5b4b .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="5b4b"}

Yes, demand exists.

But entry barriers are brutal:

- [Certifications]{#6c4c}
- [Hands-on labs]{#d8e1}
- [Continuous learning]{#6eb4}
- [Unpaid internships]{#de7d}

Freshers are told:

> *"There are thousands of jobs, but you're not ready yet."*

Even after entering the field, professionals face:

- [24/7 incident response expectations]{#8f14}
- [On-call rotations]{#1512}
- [High psychological stress]{#8c32}

Security failures are punished publicly.

Success is invisible.

### Why Gen Z Sees Through It {#2138 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="2138"}

Gen Z cybersecurity aspirants quickly realize:

- [Learning never ends]{#2b65}
- [Burnout is normalized]{#32b3}
- [Appreciation is rare]{#b9b1}

They see seniors exhausted by their early 30s.

They see certifications expiring faster than salaries rise.

So when Gen Z hesitates, it's not fear.

It's awareness.

They are not rejecting work.

They are rejecting **unsustainable careers sold as dreams**.

### Gen Z Perspective: We Didn't Quit Work --- Work Quit Us {#1e22 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="1e22"}

Gen Z grew up online.

They saw layoffs live on Twitter.

They saw influencers earn more than managers.

They saw side hustles outperform degrees.

They saw companies talk about "family" while cutting costs overnight.

This generation understands leverage earlier than any before it.

### What Gen Z Actually Wants {#fcc6 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="fcc6"}

Contrary to popular belief, Gen Z does want to work.

But they want:

- [Fair compensation]{#0e3c}
- [Clear growth paths]{#f9d1}
- [Mental health respect]{#e743}
- [Time autonomy]{#bd69}

They want work to be **a part of life**, not the price of living.

They are not impressed by titles.

They are not loyal to brands that aren't loyal to them.

And most importantly, they are unwilling to sacrifice decades for
promises that may never materialize.

### Why Anger Is the Default Emotion {#1547 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="1547"}

Gen Z was raised with hope.

They were told:

- [The future is bright]{#5a64}
- [Technology will solve everything]{#351a}
- [Degrees are investments]{#8a18}

Then reality hit.

When expectations collapse, anger fills the gap.

Not because Gen Z is entitled --- but because they were misled.

### The Real Conflict: Generations Talking Past Each Other {#cd32 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="cd32"}

Older generations say:

> *"We struggled too."*

Gen Z replies:

> *"Yes, but your struggle paid off."*

This is the disconnect.

Hard work is not the issue.

**Return on effort is.**

When effort no longer correlates with outcomes, motivation dies.

### What Needs to Change {#b37a .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="b37a"}

### For Employers {#cfae .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--h3 name="cfae"}

- [Stop demanding experience without offering training]{#ecbc}
- [Stop glorifying burnout]{#22ce}
- [Pay transparently]{#a8c5}
- [Respect time boundaries]{#0c9d}

### For Founders {#b35a .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="b35a"}

- [Build realistic growth expectations]{#b276}
- [Invest in people, not just tools]{#7e27}
- [Understand that loyalty is earned, not demanded]{#f723}

### For Educators {#2612 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="2612"}

- [Teach skills, not just theory]{#8405}
- [Be honest about outcomes]{#b2a2}
- [Align education with real-world demand]{#174e}

### For Gen Z {#5832 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="5832"}

- [Learn leverage, not dependency]{#afdb}
- [Build skills that compound]{#d5ca}
- [Protect mental health aggressively]{#032b}
- [Redefine success on your own terms]{#f721}

### Conclusion: Gen Z Isn't Broken --- The Contract Is {#a091 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="a091"}

Every generation adapts to the world it inherits.

Gen Z inherited:

- [Economic pressure]{#d25f}
- [Digital transparency]{#ca89}
- [Broken promises]{#e255}

Their refusal to blindly participate is not weakness.

It is clarity.

If Gen Z sounds angry, it's because they are.

And maybe, just maybe, that anger is justified.

The question is no longer:

> *"Why doesn't Gen Z want to work?"*

The real question is:

> *"Why should they --- under the current rules?"*
