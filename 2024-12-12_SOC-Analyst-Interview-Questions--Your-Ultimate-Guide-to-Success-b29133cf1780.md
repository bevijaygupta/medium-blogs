The role of a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst is crucial in
today's cybersecurity landscape. As threats evolve, SOC Analysts are on
the frontlines, identifying, investigating, and neutralizing risks to
protect organizational assets. Preparing for a SOC Analyst interview
involves more than just technical knowledge; it requires demonstrating
analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and the ability to thrive
under pressure.

Here's a comprehensive guide to the types of questions you may encounter
and how to ace them.
