Kali Linux is one of the most well-known and widely used penetration
testing distributions. Its versatility, vast toolset, and consistent
updates have made it a go-to platform for security professionals and
hobbyists alike. However, much of the success and continual development
of Kali Linux is thanks to contributions from the community. By enabling
open contributions, Kali Linux ensures that it remains relevant,
reliable, and filled with the latest tools and techniques.

But how can you get involved in contributing to Kali Linux? Whether
you're a seasoned developer, cybersecurity expert, or an enthusiastic

### 2. Ways to Contribute to Kali Linux {#40fa .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="40fa"}

There are multiple areas where community members can contribute to the
growth and development of Kali Linux. Whether you're a developer, a
tester, or just an enthusiast, there's a role for you.

### 2.1 Code Contributions {#8c70 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="8c70"}

Code contributions are one of the most common ways to get involved in
the Kali Linux community. Whether you want to fix bugs, add new
features, or improve existing code, there's always something to work on.

#### Types of Code Contributions {#c810 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="c810"}

- [**Bug Fixes**: Kali Linux, like any software, is prone to bugs.
  Identifying and fixing these bugs is a crucial contribution.]{#c8f8}
- [**New Tools**: If you've created a cybersecurity tool or discovered a
  tool that Kali Linux is missing, you can submit it for inclusion in
  the repository.]{#a0ce}
- [**Tool Updates**: Many of the tools bundled in Kali Linux require
  periodic updates to remain effective against current threats.]{#432d}
- [**Feature Enhancements**: Contributing to the core Kali distribution
  by adding new features or improving existing ones can have a
  significant impact.]{#2bfc}

#### How to Submit Code Contributions {#8ed7 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--li name="8ed7"}

1.  [**Set up the Development Environment**: To start contributing,
    you'll first need to set up Kali Linux on your machine and install
    the required development tools like Git, a text editor (e.g., Vim or
    VSCode), and the Kali source code.]{#2353}
2.  [**Find an Issue**: The Kali Linux GitLab repository has an issues
    tracker where bugs and feature requests are reported. You can browse
    through the list to find something you're interested in fixing or
    improving.]{#255b}
3.  [**Fork and Clone the Repository**: Fork the repository and clone it
    onto your local machine to make the necessary changes.]{#6208}
4.  [**Make the Changes**: Develop and test your changes
    locally.]{#3e40}
5.  [**Submit a Merge Request (MR)**: Once you're satisfied with your
    changes, push them to your fork and submit a Merge Request (MR) on
    GitLab. A Kali maintainer will review your contribution, suggest
    changes if needed, and approve it if it meets the project's
    standards.]{#e1d8}

### 2.2 Tool Submissions {#9260 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="9260"}

Kali Linux is known for its vast toolset, ranging from network scanners
to vulnerability exploitation tools. If you've developed a tool that
could be useful to the Kali community, you can submit it for review and
potential inclusion.

#### Submitting a New Tool {#e11e .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="e11e"}

1.  [**Ensure the Tool Fits Kali's Purpose**: Before submitting a new
    tool, ensure that it fits the purpose of Kali Linux. The tool should
    relate to penetration testing, forensics, or reverse
    engineering.]{#08a8}
2.  [**Test the Tool**: Thoroughly test the tool in different
    environments to ensure it works consistently and doesn't contain any
    critical bugs.]{#3031}
3.  [**Submit the Tool**: Kali Linux has a formal process for submitting
    new tools. You'll need to provide detailed information, including
    the tool's purpose, how to use it, dependencies, and installation
    instructions. The maintainers will review your submission, and if it
    meets the required standards, it will be added to the Kali
    repository.]{#1b42}

### 2.3 Bug Reporting and Testing {#4ee1 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="4ee1"}

Not all contributions require coding. Reporting bugs and testing new
features are essential for the continued stability of Kali Linux.

#### How to Report Bugs {#aa2c .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="aa2c"}

1.  [**Identify the Issue**: When you encounter a bug, first try to
    reproduce it to ensure it wasn't a one-off glitch. Make sure it's a
    problem specific to Kali Linux and not due to incorrect
    usage.]{#e3d3}
2.  [**Document the Bug**: When reporting a bug, include detailed
    information such as the version of Kali you're using, the specific
    tool or feature that's malfunctioning, and steps to reproduce the
    issue.]{#c04d}
3.  [**Submit the Bug Report**: Use the official Kali Bug Tracker
    (located on the Kali GitLab) to submit your bug report. Provide as
    much information as possible, including logs or screenshots if
    relevant.]{#72ea}

#### Beta Testing {#d9bb .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--li name="d9bb"}

Kali Linux often releases beta versions before pushing updates to the
main distribution. You can help by downloading these beta releases and
testing new features or tools, providing feedback on potential issues,
and verifying that the updates work as expected.

### 2.4 Writing Documentation {#8d4a .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="8d4a"}

Documentation is one of the most overlooked aspects of open-source
projects, but it's essential for the end users. Good documentation can
help beginners get started with Kali Linux, provide instructions for
using specific tools, and guide advanced users through complex tasks.

#### Types of Documentation Contributions {#15f1 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="15f1"}

- [**User Guides**: Write detailed guides or tutorials on how to use
  specific tools within Kali Linux.]{#1b30}
- [**Tool Documentation**: Each tool in Kali Linux requires clear
  documentation explaining how to use it, its features, and common use
  cases.]{#6f44}
- [**Troubleshooting Guides**: If you've encountered and solved a
  problem while using Kali Linux, documenting the process can help
  others facing the same issue.]{#d07e}

#### Submitting Documentation {#2ac2 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--li name="2ac2"}

You can contribute to the official Kali Linux documentation via Git.
Documentation contributions follow a similar process to code
contributions: fork the documentation repository, make your changes, and
submit a Merge Request.

### 2.5 Translating Kali Linux {#993c .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="993c"}

As Kali Linux is used globally, it's crucial to provide documentation
and the user interface in multiple languages. If you're fluent in a
language other than English, you can contribute by translating
documentation or interface elements.

#### How to Get Involved in Translation {#8324 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="8324"}

- [**Find Areas That Need Translation**: Check the Kali Linux GitLab or
  forums for requests for translation help.]{#a1c1}
- [**Translate Documentation or UI Elements**: Begin translating user
  guides, tutorials, or the user interface into your language.]{#3526}
- [**Submit the Translation**: Similar to code and documentation
  contributions, translations can be submitted as Merge Requests on
  GitLab.]{#2a03}
