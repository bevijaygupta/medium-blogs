In recent years, as Android OS has grown from mobile devices to various
specialized hardware, it's becoming clear that vulnerabilities in this
open-source operating system carry significant security risks,
especially in high-stakes environments like Point-of-Sale (POS)
terminals and in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) systems. A recent study by
security researcher Jacopo Jannone titled *"Exploring and Exploiting an
Android 'Smart POS' Payment Terminal"* sheds light on just how
susceptible Android-based devices can be to exploitation and the
profound implications this holds for systems beyond POS, such as
automotive security.

This blog dives deep into the techniques Jannone used to gain access to
an Android-based POS device, the security implications of his findings,
and how these insights can be applied to securing other Android-based
systems, especially those in vehicles. Let's look into the methods used,
the risks exposed, and what this means for security teams across
industries.

### The Journey: Rooting an Android POS "Smart Terminal" {#b495 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="b495"}

#### 1. Initial Access and Device Connection {#b4ad .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--h3 name="b4ad"}

To exploit the Android POS device, Jannone first had to establish a
connection to the terminal. This connection is critical for obtaining a
command line interface (CLI) from which he could execute commands and
interact directly with the device's operating system. On mobile or IoT
devices like a POS terminal, attackers typically use methods such as:

- [**USB Debugging**: Enabled through the Android Developer Options, USB
  debugging allows direct access to the Android Debug Bridge (ADB),
  which can provide extensive control over the device.]{#14ed}
- [**Wi-Fi or Network Access**: If a POS terminal is connected to a
  network, attackers might leverage remote access tools or even exploits
  within the device's network configuration to gain access.]{#0a2c}

In Jannone's case, gaining access to the POS device was the first step
in a series of actions that culminated in complete control over the
system, enabling him to modify the core functionalities.

#### 2. Command Line Access and Privilege Escalation {#db6e .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="db6e"}

Once connected, Jannone was able to secure a command line interface,
which is essential for executing commands on the Android OS. On Android,
CLI access can be used to navigate the system's directory structure,
view stored files, and even alter system files if permissions allow.

The critical next step was **privilege escalation**, a technique that
involves increasing one's access level on a device, often to "root"
access. Rooting an Android device essentially grants the user superuser
permissions, allowing unrestricted access to system files and settings.
To accomplish this, Jannone likely employed one or more of the
following:

- [**Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities**: Some Android versions or
  devices have unpatched vulnerabilities that allow privilege
  escalation. Tools like Magisk or SuperSU can root devices by
  exploiting such weaknesses.]{#352b}
- [**System Vulnerability Exploits**: Android updates often patch
  privilege escalation vulnerabilities, but older or non-updated devices
  remain vulnerable. Attackers can use these known exploits to gain root
  access.]{#10bd}

Achieving root access was the pivotal moment for Jannone, as it allowed
him full control over the device. With this power, he could now alter
system functions, monitor data, and, critically, modify how the POS
terminal handled sensitive information.

### Data Capture: Modifying the POS to Store Sensitive Data {#d9f0 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="d9f0"}

After rooting the POS terminal, Jannone took steps to configure it to
capture and store sensitive information from transactions. This
involved:

- [**Modifying System Functions**: With root access, Jannone was able to
  modify how the device processes and logs information, effectively
  redirecting sensitive data into storage.]{#1d71}
- [**Capturing Payment Details in Plain Text**: Most POS systems are
  designed to encrypt card data and PINs as they are processed. By
  intercepting these data flows at the system level, Jannone could store
  details like card numbers, expiration dates, and PINs in plain
  text --- an incredibly risky manipulation that would otherwise be
  prevented by standard encryption.]{#4b80}

Such modifications expose the disturbing possibility that similar
methods could be used to intercept and store sensitive data on any
rooted Android device, including in-vehicle infotainment systems that
may process payment data or sensitive personal information.

### Implications for the Automotive Industry: Can the Same Techniques Be Applied? {#53a3 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="53a3"}

As Android becomes increasingly popular in the automotive industry,
especially within in-vehicle infotainment systems, security
vulnerabilities discovered on POS terminals pose a significant concern
for car manufacturers. Android's adaptability has made it an appealing
choice for IVI systems, but that flexibility also means that Android in
vehicles is susceptible to similar vulnerabilities. Here's how these
techniques might impact automotive security:

#### 1. In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) Systems as Android Devices {#4cae .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="4cae"}

Modern IVI systems are highly connected and can integrate with
smartphones, display navigation, offer voice control, and in some cases,
even allow purchases from the vehicle's dashboard. An Android-based IVI
system with internet access and app integration opens the door to
similar exploitation techniques used in POS devices, such as:

- [**Root Access Exploits**: Attackers could theoretically use rooting
  techniques to gain command line access to an IVI system, allowing them
  to monitor and modify system data.]{#aed6}
- [**Sensitive Data Capture**: IVI systems that support in-car payments,
  either for parking or other services, could be manipulated to store
  sensitive transaction data if they are compromised, much like the POS
  terminal.]{#f6ab}
- [**Interfacing with Vehicle Functions**: With root access to an IVI
  system, an attacker might even be able to interact with the car's
  critical systems, such as GPS, climate control, or, in worst-case
  scenarios, even diagnostic functions. While IVI systems are typically
  sandboxed away from essential safety functions, vulnerabilities in
  system design could potentially be exploited.]{#95d2}

#### 2. Vehicle Tracking and Driver Privacy {#468c .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--li name="468c"}

Rooting an IVI system would not only expose potential payment data but
could also allow an attacker to monitor vehicle movement and driver
habits. GPS data, route history, and even driver behavior could be
logged and accessed, creating a severe invasion of privacy.

*Case in Point*: Imagine a scenario where an attacker modifies the IVI
system to record all audio interactions in the car, capturing private
conversations. This surveillance could be exploited for malicious
purposes, and the driver would have no way of knowing.

#### 3. Security and Safety Risks for Connected Vehicles {#6f67 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="6f67"}

As vehicles become increasingly connected, the integration of
Android-based systems extends beyond infotainment into Advanced Driver
Assistance Systems (ADAS) and even semi-autonomous features. A rooted
Android system could, in theory, grant an attacker access to telemetry
data, sensor readings, and more. While it may seem far-fetched, such
exploits could open doors to interfering with driving functionality,
highlighting the need for rigorous security protocols in Android
automotive systems.

### How Security Teams Can Mitigate Risks in Android-Based Systems {#8c60 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="8c60"}

The automotive industry, POS manufacturers, and any industry relying on
Android-based systems must address these potential vulnerabilities to
safeguard sensitive information and maintain user safety. Here are some
key takeaways from Jannone's research for implementing robust security
measures:

#### 1. Implement Strong Root Detection Mechanisms {#f4a2 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="f4a2"}

Security teams should ensure that their devices have built-in root
detection mechanisms. These mechanisms can detect if a device has been
rooted or tampered with, and either limit its functionality or alert
security personnel. In the automotive industry, root detection could
ensure that any tampering with the IVI system triggers a security
response, like disabling sensitive features or limiting app permissions.

#### 2. Regular Security Audits and Updates {#7da7 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="7da7"}

Regular security audits should be part of any organization's strategy
for Android-based systems. Routine penetration tests can help identify
potential exploits before they are discovered by attackers.
Manufacturers should also commit to releasing regular updates and
patches, especially for systems that manage sensitive information.

#### 3. Isolation of Sensitive Data Pathways {#b283 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="b283"}

In both POS and automotive applications, sensitive data like payment
details should be processed in isolated environments, away from general
application and user-accessible areas. Encrypting and compartmentalizing
data at multiple points in the data path can prevent a compromised
device from leaking sensitive information.

#### 4. Enhanced Monitoring and Logging {#54b9 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="54b9"}

Security teams can employ enhanced logging and monitoring protocols to
detect suspicious activity in real-time. Unusual access patterns,
unauthorized attempts to gain system privileges, or access to sensitive
functions can be logged and flagged for review, allowing timely
interventions.

#### 5. User Education and Awareness {#7043 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="7043"}

Although end-users are typically unaware of security nuances, informing
them about best practices can mitigate some risks. Encouraging users to
keep their devices updated, avoid third-party apps, and restrict
permissions can enhance security on Android systems.
