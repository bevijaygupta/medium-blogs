Google has recently addressed a high-severity zero-day vulnerability in
its Chrome browser, identified as CVE-2024--7971. This vulnerability
involves a type of confusion issue within the V8 JavaScript engine,
which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

The flaw was reported by the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center
(MSTIC) and the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) on August 19,
2024, and is known to be actively exploited in the wild.

Google has acknowledged the active exploitation of this
[vulnerability](https://cybersecuritynews.com/top-10-vulnerabilities-that-were-exploited-the-most-in-2023/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://cybersecuritynews.com/top-10-vulnerabilities-that-were-exploited-the-most-in-2023/"
rel="noreferrer noopener noopener" target="_blank"} and has released
updates to mitigate the risk to users.

### High Severity Vulnerabilities in Chrome 128 {#68c6 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="68c6"}

The latest Chrome update, version 128.0.6613.84/.85, addresses a total
of 38 security vulnerabilities. Below are the high-severity flaws that
were highlighted:

- [**CVE-2024--7964**: A use-after-free vulnerability in the Passwords
  component, reported by an anonymous researcher on August 8, 2024. This
  type of vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution or a crash
  when the program accesses memory that has already been freed.]{#17fe}
- [**CVE-2024--7965**: An inappropriate implementation issue in the V8
  JavaScript engine, reported by a researcher known as TheDog on July
  30, 2024. This can potentially allow attackers to execute arbitrary
  code.]{#f473}
- [**CVE-2024--7966**: An out-of-bounds memory access flaw in the Skia
  graphics library, reported by Renan Rios on July 25, 2024. This
  vulnerability can lead to memory corruption, potentially allowing
  remote code execution.]{#fa98}
- [**CVE-2024--7967**: A heap buffer overflow in the Fonts component,
  reported by Tashita Software Security on July 27, 2024. Such
  vulnerabilities can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.]{#fc18}
- [**CVE-2024--7968**: Another use-after-free issue, this time in the
  Autofill component, was reported by Han Zheng from HexHive on June 25,
  2024.]{#5d72}
- [**CVE-2024--7969**: A type confusion vulnerability in the V8 engine,
  reported by the CFF of Topsec Alpha Team on July 9, 2024.]{#9ff5}
- [**CVE-2024--7971**: As mentioned earlier, this type confusion
  vulnerability in V8 is actively exploited and was reported by
  Microsoft.]{#df93}

These vulnerabilities are critical as they can allow attackers to
execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to data breaches or system
compromise.

Google has rolled out
[updates](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2024/08/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_21.html){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2024/08/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_21.html"
rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener" target="_blank"} to mitigate
these vulnerabilities and recommends users update their browsers to the
latest version to ensure protection against these exploits.

These vulnerabilities have been addressed in the latest Chrome version
128.0.6613.84 for Linux and 128.0.6613.84/.85 for Windows and Mac.

Users are strongly advised to update to the latest version of Google
Chrome to protect against these vulnerabilities. Chrome updates
automatically, but users can manually check for updates by going to
Settings \> About Chrome.

Additionally, users of Chromium-based browsers such as Microsoft Edge,
Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi should also apply the latest security updates
as they become available.
