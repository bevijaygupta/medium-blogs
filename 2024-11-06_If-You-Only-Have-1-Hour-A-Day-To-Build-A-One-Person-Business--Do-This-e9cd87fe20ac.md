When you have only an hour each day to work on your business, every
moment must be used intentionally. Focusing on high-impact tasks,
leveraging automation, and building sustainable habits are essential to
see meaningful progress in such limited time. In this guide, we'll break
down a streamlined approach to creating and scaling a one-person
business in one hour a day.

### Section 1: Define Your Business Focus and Target Audience {#e38d .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="e38d"}

#### Day 1--5: Identify Your Niche and Target Audience {#a883 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--h3 name="a883"}

In a one-person business, it's crucial to have clarity on what you're
offering and who you're offering it to. Narrow down to a niche that
aligns with your skills, interests, and market demand. With a clear
niche, you'll be more effective in the limited time you have.

- [**Action Steps:**]{#262f}
- [Spend time researching online forums, social media, and Google Trends
  to validate your ideas.]{#09d7}
- [Identify a target audience for your business based on demographics,
  interests, and pain points.]{#6ef7}

  value.]{#b9d8}

#### Day 6--7: Set Your Business Goals {#a779 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--li name="a779"}

Set SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals
that align with your business vision. Goals will help you remain focused
on tasks that matter most.

- [**Action Steps:**]{#1456}

#### Week 2: Create Your Minimal Viable Product (MVP) {#085b .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--h3 name="085b"}

  page to showcase your service and enable bookings or
  inquiries.]{#9481}

#### Week 3: Price Your Product or Service {#e203 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--li name="e203"}

pricing strategy should cover your costs, reflect the value you provide,
and be competitive.

### Tips for Sustaining Momentum with Limited Time {#8f72 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="8f72"}

    contribute to revenue generation, such as marketing, client
