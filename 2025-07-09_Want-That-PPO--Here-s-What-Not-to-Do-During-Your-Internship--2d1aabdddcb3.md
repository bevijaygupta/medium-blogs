Let's be real. Internships are not just internships anymore.

They're auditions. Trial runs. Sneaky job interviews in disguise. And
yes --- *you're being watched* (in a good way, mostly).

Now, don't panic. I'm not here to spook you into becoming a corporate
robot or tell you to bring coffee for everyone like you're in a 2005
rom-com. But I *am* here to help you avoid the five cardinal sins that
have robbed many smart, hardworking interns of a PPO (Pre-Placement
Offer) they absolutely *could* have earned.

So grab your coffee, open a new tab only after you finish reading this
(yes, I'm watching), and let's talk about the 5 things you should NEVER
do during your internship --- unless you like rejection emails.

### 1. Treating it Like "Just an Internship" {#a1bb .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="a1bb"}

Let's start with the biggest mistake I've seen: the "chill intern"
mindset.

You know the type. Rolls in late at 11:15 a.m. with a croissant and iced
latte. Logs off the moment the clock strikes 6:00 p.m. (or earlier, if
they think no one will notice). Puts in the bare minimum.

**Reality check:** You weren't hired to warm a seat.

This isn't college. No one gives you extra marks for attendance. If you
think your job is to show up, nod occasionally, and vanish into the
Google Meet abyss --- *you're already behind*.

### What to do instead: {#e3c2 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="e3c2"}

Start behaving like it's your **first full-time job**, not a two-month
pit stop.

- [Be punctual. (No, not "startup time" punctual. Actual
  punctual.)]{#9767}
- [Be proactive. Ask your manager what's on the agenda.]{#188a}
- [Be dependable. If you say you'll get something done --- do it, and do
  it well.]{#c8c8}

Treating it like a dream role doesn't mean sucking up or working until
11 p.m. every day. It means showing initiative, being curious, and
acting like your contributions matter. Because they do.

And trust me --- your manager is noticing *everything*. Even that time
you joined the call from your bed.

### 2. Staying Invisible in Meetings {#c35e .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="c35e"}

The number of interns who stay silent for an entire internship could
form a rock band called "The Mute Icons."

I get it. Meetings can be intimidating. You're the new kid in a room
full of experienced professionals. What if your idea sounds dumb? What
if you interrupt someone important?

Here's the deal: *Silence isn't golden during internships.*

Being invisible in meetings is a missed opportunity to showcase your
thinking, confidence, and willingness to engage. You're not expected to
solve world hunger, but you *are* expected to be present --- mentally
and vocally.

### What to do instead: {#ef15 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="ef15"}

- [Ask thoughtful questions. ("Why did we choose this approach?" is a
  great start.)]{#a8a3}
- [Share your insights. Even small observations can add value.]{#1bec}
- [React. Nod, smile, say "that makes sense." Be human.]{#c58d}

Don't just exist in a corner of the Zoom window. Make yourself seen.
Because if no one remembers your voice, how can they fight for your PPO
later?

### 3. Only Doing What's Assigned {#60b7 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="60b7"}

Look, we all love a neat little checklist.

But if all you're doing is exactly what's written in the task manager
and nothing more --- you're missing the point.

Great interns don't just check boxes --- they *build* them.

They say, "Hey, I noticed this bug and fixed it," or "This report looked
outdated, so I refreshed the data," or "Our onboarding doc could use
some love --- can I improve it?"

### What to do instead: {#d4a7 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="d4a7"}

- [**Volunteer.** For extra tasks, for stretch projects, for things no
  one else wants.]{#1c6f}
- [**Support.** Ask your teammates, "Need help with anything?"]{#7be2}
- [**Solve.** Find problems before they explode and be the reason they
  *don't*.]{#7702}

Managers love interns who think like owners, not assistants. Surprise
them with your initiative, not just your ability to follow instructions.

In short: Don't be a "CTRL+C, CTRL+V" intern.

### 4. Never Asking for Feedback {#515d .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="515d"}

This one hurts to watch.

So many interns quietly assume, *"Well, no one's complaining, so I must
be doing great!"*

WRONG.

Silence is not praise. It's just... silence.

Many managers are juggling multiple tasks, meetings, and deadlines. They
might forget to offer feedback unless you ask. And if you wait until the
final week to ask how you did --- well, it's probably too late.

### What to do instead: {#772f .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="772f"}

- [**Ask early.** Even in Week 1, say, "Hey! How can I be more useful to
  the team?"]{#6374}
- [**Ask often.** Weekly check-ins help course correct before it's too
  late.]{#318d}
- [**Be specific.** Ask things like "Was my approach okay?" or "Should I
  prioritize differently?"]{#65f4}

Also, don't get defensive. If your manager says, "This could've been
better," thank them. Improve. Come back stronger.

Interns who grow fast, adapt quickly, and take feedback seriously often
become employees who grow into leaders.

### 5. Forgetting You're Building Relationships, Not Just Completing Tasks {#3f38 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="3f38"}

Here's a wild idea: Your internship isn't just about tasks. It's about
**people**.

You're not a bot. You're a *potential teammate*.

If you spend the entire internship with your head down, clicking away in
silence, avoiding every team lunch, never messaging a peer, and skipping
optional events --- guess what? You'll be forgotten faster than a
browser tab after five hours of doom-scrolling.

### What to do instead: {#0e67 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="0e67"}

- [**Be social.** Attend that casual meet-up. Say hi in the chat.
  Comment on someone's win.]{#5d89}
- [**Be curious.** Ask your colleagues what they work on, or how they
  got into the company.]{#79fa}
- [**Be helpful.** Share articles, give shoutouts, offer
  support.]{#1b93}

Some PPO decisions are made based on *how much the team likes working
with you* --- not just the quality of your work.

No one wants to hire a genius who doesn't gel with the team. But they'll
*always* root for someone who's collaborative, approachable, and
genuinely involved.

### The Truth: Your PPO is Decided in Week 1, Not Week 12 {#3efc .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="3efc"}

Let that sink in.

Your *first impression* is not a warm-up. It's a head start --- or a red
flag.

Managers and teams start forming their opinions in the first few days.
Are you dependable? Are you a culture fit? Are you interested, or just
interesting?

Your behavior, communication, curiosity, work ethic --- all these things
start painting a picture early on.

### So start strong: {#ac94 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="ac94"}

- [Make your presence known.]{#a0a5}
- [Deliver your best work.]{#b1a4}
- [Connect with humans, not just projects.]{#75b5}
- [Learn like a sponge, but act like a contributor.]{#0add}

### Final Thoughts: Don't Intern. Impress. {#25bb .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="25bb"}

Look, no one's asking you to be perfect.

You're an intern. You're here to learn, grow, and explore. But if you
*really* want that PPO, you have to go beyond just showing up.

You have to show that you're *already* ready to be a full-time
teammate --- someone who adds value, energy, and perspective.

Avoid these five career-killing mistakes, and you won't just survive
your internship --- you'll thrive, and maybe walk away with that sweet,
sweet offer letter in hand.

Good luck. And hey --- go be the intern your future self would hire.
