The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a paradigm shift in technology,
linking everyday objects to the internet to create a seamless flow of
data. As the world becomes more interconnected, IoT companies are at the
forefront of this transformation, driving innovations that redefine how
we live, work, and interact with our environment. This blog explores the
landscape of IoT companies, their impact on various industries,
challenges they face, and the future of IoT.

#### What is IoT? {#0110 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="0110"}

IoT refers to the network of physical objects embedded with sensors,
software, and other technologies to connect and exchange data with other
devices and systems over the internet. These objects, or "things," can
range from household appliances and wearable devices to industrial
machinery and smart cities infrastructure.

#### The Evolution of IoT {#b1be .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="b1be"}

The concept of IoT has evolved over the decades. The idea of connected
devices dates back to the early 1980s with the first internet-connected
appliance, a Coke machine at Carnegie Mellon University. However, the
term "Internet of Things" was coined by Kevin Ashton in 1999,
envisioning a world where the internet extends beyond computers to
everyday objects. Since then, advancements in wireless technology,
miniaturization of sensors, and the proliferation of mobile devices have
accelerated the growth of IoT.
