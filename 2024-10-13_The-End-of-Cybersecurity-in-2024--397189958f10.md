### 1. A Year of Transformative Threats and Cyber Events in 2024 {#ee75 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="ee75"}

The last year has seen some of the most devastating and disruptive
cyberattacks in recent history. From ransomware attacks crippling
national infrastructure to large-scale data breaches exposing millions
of users' personal information, 2024 has shown that cybercriminals are
becoming more brazen and capable. These threats have changed the
narrative on how organizations and governments approach cybersecurity,
revealing some key limitations in current defensive strategies:

#### Rise of AI-Powered Cyber Attacks {#abfe .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="abfe"}

Artificial intelligence has played a dual role in cybersecurity. While
defenders have leveraged AI for threat detection and incident response,
hackers are now using AI-powered techniques to launch more sophisticated
attacks. In 2024, AI-driven malware and phishing schemes were widely
reported, allowing hackers to bypass traditional defenses by analyzing
targets, adapting tactics, and generating highly customized attacks.

#### Quantum Computing Threats on the Horizon {#9dd1 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="9dd1"}

Though still in its infancy, quantum computing is beginning to influence
the cybersecurity landscape. In 2024, there was significant research
into quantum attacks, which threaten to break traditional encryption
methods. Although this technology is not yet fully developed, the mere
possibility has forced organizations to consider new encryption
standards, leading to the term "post-quantum cryptography" becoming a
priority.

#### Increased Sophistication of Ransomware Attacks {#6aa0 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="6aa0"}

Ransomware has evolved beyond simple file encryption to include data
theft and extortion. In 2024, attacks targeting critical infrastructure
increased, with many organizations paying ransoms simply to avoid
extended downtime and loss of reputation. The advent of
Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) has lowered the barrier to entry for
cybercriminals, allowing even those with limited technical knowledge to
launch disruptive attacks.

### 2. The Downfall of Traditional Cybersecurity Practices {#62a5 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="62a5"}

Given these evolving threats, traditional cybersecurity models are
struggling to keep pace. In 2024, a notable trend has been the shift
away from purely defensive approaches. Instead, organizations are
adopting more proactive and adaptable strategies, which are essential
given the limitations of traditional methods:

#### Signature-Based Detection is Losing Relevance {#5c6b .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="5c6b"}

Traditional antivirus software relies on signature-based detection,
which identifies malware based on known patterns. However, with the rise
of polymorphic malware --- malicious software that constantly changes
its code --- signature-based detection has proven increasingly
ineffective. In 2024, organizations started moving towards behavioral
analysis and machine learning models that detect unusual activity, but
even these are not foolproof.

#### Perimeter Security Models are Obsolete {#58e0 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="58e0"}

The days of secure network perimeters are long gone. With the explosion
of remote work, IoT devices, and cloud computing, the traditional
approach of securing a corporate network perimeter is no longer
sufficient. Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) has emerged as the new
standard, emphasizing that every access request, both inside and outside
the network, should be verified. In 2024, Zero Trust became a necessity,
not a luxury, as organizations struggled with the expanded attack
surface.

#### Lack of Skilled Cybersecurity Professionals {#b9ad .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="b9ad"}

2024 also highlighted a severe shortage of skilled cybersecurity
professionals, leading many companies to rely on automation. While
automation has its benefits, the lack of skilled human analysts to
interpret and respond to complex cyber threats has weakened traditional
cybersecurity practices. This shortage has driven organizations to
invest in upskilling their workforce and expanding collaboration with
cybersecurity firms to fill the gaps.

As cyberattacks become faster and more complex, automated threat
response systems will be crucial in 2025. Security Orchestration,
Automation, and Response (SOAR) platforms allow organizations to
automate routine tasks, freeing up human analysts to focus on more
complex issues. This automation will also speed up response times,
making it more difficult for attackers to carry out their objectives.

#### Blockchain for Cybersecurity {#a0a0 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="a0a0"}

Blockchain technology, once primarily associated with cryptocurrency, is
finding new applications in cybersecurity. Its decentralized, immutable
nature makes it an ideal solution for securing data and verifying
identities. In 2025, blockchain-based cybersecurity solutions will
become more prevalent, helping organizations protect data, detect fraud,
and improve transparency.

#### Cyber Resilience Over Cybersecurity {#e89c .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="e89c"}

While cybersecurity focuses on preventing and responding to attacks,
cyber resilience emphasizes an organization's ability to continue
operating during and after a cyberattack. In 2025, expect to see a
greater emphasis on building cyber-resilient systems that can withstand
and quickly recover from cyber incidents. This shift will be driven by
the increasing frequency and severity of cyberattacks, making resilience
