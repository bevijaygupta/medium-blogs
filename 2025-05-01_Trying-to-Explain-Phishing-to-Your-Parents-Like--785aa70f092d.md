Let me set the scene.

It's a calm Sunday afternoon. Birds are chirping, your laundry is
half-done, and you're trying to ignore the existential crisis brewing in
the back of your mind. Suddenly, your mom calls. Not to ask how you are
(of course not), but because she received an email from "Amazon" saying
she won a new iPhone 15 Pro Max.

"All I had to do was enter my credit card details to cover the shipping
fee," she says, sounding excited, as if she's just won the lottery of
life.

Your soul leaves your body.

You teleport to her house in under 4.6 seconds. There she is, sipping
her tea, basking in the glow of her digital fortune, oblivious to the
cyber chaos she almost invited into her life.

This, my friends, is what trying to explain phishing to your parents is
like. It's like trying to teach a goldfish how to set up two-factor
authentication.

**The Phish Are Biting, Mom.**

"No, Mom, it's not a real fish," I begin, already regretting my life
choices. "Phishing with a PH, not an F. It's when cybercriminals pretend
to be legit companies to steal your personal information."

Blank stare.

"So it's like a fake Amazon?" she asks, squinting at her ancient iPad
like it might give her the answers if she looks hard enough.

"Yes, exactly! But more evil. Think of it like a digital con artist.
Like that guy who sold you the 'genuine' Ray-Bans in 1997 outside the
train station. Except now he wears a hoodie and lives in his mom's
basement in Romania."

She gasps. "How do they know I shop at Amazon?"

Oh boy.

"Because, Mom, everyone shops at Amazon. It's not personal. It's like
throwing a net into the ocean. Someone's bound to get caught."

**Dad Joins In: The Plot Thickens**

At this point, Dad walks in, somehow already defensive.

"I never click those links," he says proudly, the same way he says, "I
don't need GPS," right before getting lost in his own neighborhood.

"Good, Dad. That's smart."

"Except that one time when Apple emailed me about my account being
hacked. I clicked to be safe."

My eye twitches.

"Dad, that wasn't Apple. Apple doesn't have your AOL email address."

He looks wounded. "But it had their logo and everything."

Ah yes. Because no hacker has ever right-clicked and saved an image.

**Why It's So Hard to Explain**

Here's the real kicker. Our parents grew up in a time when you trusted
the mailman, the bank teller, and the nice man in the suit selling
vacuum cleaners. The idea that someone would spend their entire day
sending fake emails just to steal your Netflix login is not just absurd
to them --- it's borderline science fiction.

Try explaining that someone can copy-paste a website to make it look
like PayPal.

"So you're saying I have to look at the *URL*?"

"Yes, Mom. If it says 'paypal.scammy.ru.biz' it's not real PayPal."

"But what if I click it by accident?"

"Then you might as well give them your social security number and your
Netflix password and call it a day."

She gasps again. "But I share that Netflix account with Aunt Sheila!"

Exactly.

**The Wild Email Jungle**

The modern email inbox is like walking through a jungle. Some paths lead
to treasure (like a 20% off coupon from your favorite store), and others
are disguised pits with wooden spikes covered by banana leaves. Your
parents are walking through this jungle barefoot, eyes closed, with a
wallet hanging from a chain around their neck.

"But how do I tell what's real and what's fake?"

Great question, Mom.

- [Does the email greet you with a generic "Dear Customer"?]{#155c}
- [Is the grammar worse than Dad's DIY plumbing job?]{#fc2a}
- [Is the email address something like
  support@paypal-services.info.biz?]{#7581}
- [Is it asking you to click something urgently?]{#9586}

If yes to any, congratulations: it's a scam!

**The Emotional Bait**

Scammers are master manipulators. They know how to trigger emotion.

Fear: "Your account will be closed in 24 hours unless you act now!"
Greed: "You've won a \$500 Amazon gift card!" Curiosity: "Click here to
see what your neighbor said about you."

Your parents are especially vulnerable because they didn't grow up
dodging catfish and spyware and fake tech support calls. They grew up
with landlines, handwritten letters, and people who only stole from you
in person.

**Okay, So What Can You Do?**

Short of building a bunker and tossing all electronics in it, here's the
plan:

1.  [**Enable Two-Factor Authentication** Yes, I know it's a pain. But
    it's the digital equivalent of putting two locks on your door. If
    your dad complains, just remind him he locks the shed with *three*
    padlocks.]{#6392}
2.  [**Use a Password Manager** They'll grumble at first, but once they
    realize they don't need to remember that "password1234" isn't safe
    anymore, they'll thank you.]{#bb8f}
3.  [**Install Antivirus Software** Think of it like the dog that barks
    when sketchy people walk past the house. Let the software
    bark.]{#37e4}
4.  [**Teach the Golden Rule** "If it looks too good to be true, it
    probably is." Unless it's cookies. Then it's just your kid trying to
    butter you up for a new Xbox.]{#779d}
5.  [**Regular Digital Checkups** Sit with them once a month. Check
    their inbox, update their passwords, delete suspicious messages.
    Also, remind them not to click on ads that say, "This Shark Tank
    product will make you lose belly fat in 10 days."]{#b2bd}

**Bonus: Scam Call Theater**

When the scam callers come knocking (and they will), turn it into a
game. Train your parents to ask them questions like:

- ["Oh really? What's my name then?"]{#1b06}
- ["Can you hold while I grab a pen?" *Leaves phone for 17
  minutes.*]{#10be}
- ["My son works in cybersecurity. Would you like to speak with
  him?"]{#7fa2}

Better yet, let your dad answer in a dramatic cowboy accent. Give the
scammers a story to remember.

**Wrapping It Up (With a Firewall)**

Explaining phishing to your parents is an ongoing, patience-testing,
occasionally hilarious journey. You'll need analogies. You'll need
memes. You'll need to accept that one day they'll forward you a WhatsApp
message about how hackers are installing viruses through pizza delivery
boxes.

But it's okay. Because they taught you how to ride a bike, eat
vegetables, and survive the real world. Now it's your turn to help them
survive the digital one.

Just take a deep breath, pour some coffee, and begin again with:

"Okay, Mom, remember what I said about links...?"
