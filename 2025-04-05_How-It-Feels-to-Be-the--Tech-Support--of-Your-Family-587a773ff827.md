Let's face it, being the tech support for your family is a role that
nobody ever signs up for, but somehow, you get thrust into it. One
minute you're minding your business, enjoying a relaxing evening, and
the next minute, your phone rings with the familiar, dreaded words:
"Hey, I need your help with my computer." And just like that, you're
back to being the family's 24/7 on-call tech support, even though you
didn't sign any contract.

If you're the designated "tech person" in your family, you know exactly
what I'm talking about. In fact, you're probably already mentally
preparing yourself for the next round of questions before you've even
finished reading this sentence. So, grab your favorite beverage, sit
back, and let's dive into the highs and lows of being the tech support
hero (or villain) of your family.

### Chapter 1: The Unwelcome Title {#0458 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="0458"}

Let's start with the obvious: You never asked for this job. It's not
something you woke up one day and thought, "Wow, I can't wait to fix
Aunt Karen's printer for the seventh time this week." Nope, it starts
innocently enough with a few casual questions. Maybe your cousin needs
help with a phone issue, or your mom is asking you how to use "that
TikTok thing." Next thing you know, you're the one people turn to
whenever anything goes wrong with a gadget, a device, or a Wi-Fi
connection.

<figure id="83df" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p">
<img
src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*BSGe8SNDyCxkFrdH.jpg"
class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*BSGe8SNDyCxkFrdH.jpg"
data-width="1000" data-height="1200" />
</figure>

But here's the thing: you don't get a badge or a raise for this role.
No, your reward is usually a simple "thanks" before your family member
walks off, leaving you wondering why you've spent the last hour trying
to fix a problem that could have been solved by pressing the "on"
button.

And don't even get me started on the fact that you're the tech support,
but you're still expected to "figure it out" for free. A simple 'thank
you' doesn't feel like enough when you're the one who's been called on
to troubleshoot a five-minute problem that's turned into a two-hour
session.

### Chapter 2: The Classic "It's Not Working" Problem {#daa5 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="daa5"}

Ah, yes, the infamous "It's not working!" complaint. This one is like a
dagger to the heart for anyone who's ever worked in tech support. You've
heard it so many times you can practically recite it in your sleep.

<figure id="f408" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p">
<img
src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*8pERdjSwaiMz4HCO.png"
class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*8pERdjSwaiMz4HCO.png"
data-width="1086" data-height="909" />
</figure>

Here's how the conversation usually goes:

- [**Mom:** "The Wi-Fi isn't working. Can you fix it?"]{#1a16}
- [**You:** "Have you tried restarting the router?"]{#c030}
- [**Mom:** "What do you mean by restarting? Do I just unplug
  it?"]{#42f6}
- [**You:** "Yes, unplug it, wait 10 seconds, then plug it back
  in."]{#84fe}
- [**Mom:** "Okay, I did it. But it's still not working!"]{#a7ca}
- [**You:** "Did you restart your device too?"]{#8697}
- [**Mom:** "What device? The Wi-Fi thing?"]{#b46e}

At this point, you know this conversation is going nowhere fast, and
you're mentally preparing for the inevitable next step: You're going to
have to drive over there and handle it in person because, of course,
explaining things over the phone is just too complicated for Aunt Judy's
"computer."

And let's be real: the Wi-Fi issue wasn't the problem. It was probably
her laptop being connected to the neighbor's Wi-Fi and not realizing it.
But sure, let's blame the router again, because why not?

### Chapter 3: The "Have You Tried Turning It Off and On Again?" Syndrome {#c998 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="c998"}

Every seasoned tech support person has mastered the art of the classic
troubleshooting step: "Have you tried turning it off and on again?" It's
the universal remedy to all tech problems. Your family thinks it's a
miracle cure, and you start to feel like a wizard casting a spell. It
works most of the time (because, surprise, the problem usually is that
simple). But when it doesn't work, you end up hearing this from your
mom:

<figure id="f0d9" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p">
<img
src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*JqhwYYfVIJuZ0ue4.png"
class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*JqhwYYfVIJuZ0ue4.png"
data-width="256" data-height="275" />
</figure>

- [**Mom:** "I've already tried that, but nothing changed."]{#abda}
- [**You:** "Are you sure you turned it off completely?"]{#97bf}
- [**Mom:** "I clicked the power button! It's off now!"]{#b051}
- [**You:** "How long did you leave it off?"]{#8cb4}
- [**Mom:** "Oh, like two seconds."]{#cb77}

You take a deep breath. You remind yourself that patience is a virtue.
Then you calmly explain that the device needs at least 10 seconds to
reboot properly, and you silently curse the universe that put you in
this position.

### Chapter 4: The Printer Saga {#b9cf .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="b9cf"}

Oh, the printer. A device so simple yet so capable of turning you into a
professional therapist. You could write a whole book just on the printer
issues you've had to endure. Here's a fun fact: printers are never easy
to fix. In fact, printers seem to have a personal vendetta against you.
Whether it's running out of ink for the 100th time, printing everything
in pink, or refusing to print at all, the printer is the eternal enemy
in every tech support war.

<figure id="98e3" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p">
<img
src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*6WwpIL3HxFFDhzzi.gif"
class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*6WwpIL3HxFFDhzzi.gif"
data-width="529" data-height="399" />
</figure>

Your family, however, refuses to accept that the printer is *always* the
problem. They come to you asking, "Can you fix this printer? It's not
printing anything!" And of course, you get your hands dirty trying to
figure it out, only to realize that the printer has somehow lost its
connection to the Wi-Fi network, or someone forgot to load paper. Again.

And let's not forget the time-consuming drama that is installing new
printer drivers. You think you're done, and then you realize it's not
connected to the computer anymore, or it's printing *random pages* from
last month. The struggle is real.

### Chapter 5: The Never-Ending Phone Support {#d72b .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="d72b"}

Being tech support for your family doesn't just end with computers and
printers. Oh no, it's a 24/7 gig. Next, you're being bombarded with
questions about how to free up storage on your brother's phone, how to
get his broken screen to work, or why his phone keeps showing "No
service" when he's standing right next to the router.

And what's with the endless "What app should I download?" inquiries? You
suddenly become the family's unofficial Google Play Store or Apple App
Store. "Hey, I need a good photo editor." "Can you recommend a podcast
app?" "What's the best workout app?" These questions flood your life,
making you question if you should just start charging an hourly rate for
your "expert" advice.

### Chapter 6: The Overestimation of Your Tech Skills {#fbd3 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="fbd3"}

You'd think being the family's tech expert means you're respected for
your knowledge. However, this couldn't be further from the truth.
Instead, your family has a tendency to overestimate your skills and
treat you like the walking, talking version of Google.

- [**Dad:** "Hey, can you hack into my old email account? I think I
  forgot the password."]{#3506}
- [**You:** "Uh, that's not really how it works. I'm not a hacker, I'm
  just good with computers."]{#31f6}
- [**Dad:** "Oh, come on, you're the tech guy. You can figure it
  out!"]{#3b26}

At this point, you realize your family has mistaken you for a secret
agent who can break into systems, bypass firewalls, and magically
restore passwords. The pressure is on, but instead of solving a security
issue, you end up explaining the importance of having strong, memorable
passwords. Not exactly the exciting tech-life you imagined.

### Chapter 7: The Incredibly Detailed Text Message {#6a4e .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="6a4e"}

Ah, and then there are the texts. You know, the ones that give you a
full description of the problem that makes no sense, leading to you
questioning the very existence of language.

- [**Cousin:** "My phone is doing that thing, you know, where the screen
  goes all blue, but then it does like the flash thing, and I tried
  pressing the button, but nothing happened. So can you come over and
  fix it?"]{#8437}
- [**You:** "What exactly happened? Can you describe the problem in more
  detail?"]{#d27b}
- [**Cousin:** "Yeah, the phone is like broken. It won't turn
  on."]{#e52b}

These texts usually require a whole back-and-forth game of "tech
detective" where you try to piece together the vague details and figure
out what exactly went wrong. Was it a software issue? A hardware issue?
Is it an issue that requires a full reset, or is it something as simple
as the phone needing to be charged?

### Chapter 8: The Payback Moment (Spoiler Alert: It Never Comes) {#fee0 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="fee0"}

So you've been the tech support guru for your family for years. You've
helped, fixed, and explained, and all you ask in return is a little
acknowledgment. Maybe a nice homemade dinner or an offer to take out the
trash. But, as with every family dynamic, that moment of gratitude is
often fleeting or nonexistent.

And when it does come, it usually involves someone saying, "Hey, thanks
for fixing my phone, but can you also look at the computer tomorrow?"
It's a never-ending cycle, my friends.

### Conclusion: The Eternal Struggle {#ddbc .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="ddbc"}

Being the tech support for your family is a job that never ends. You're
constantly faced with questions you've already answered 100 times,
trying to explain things in a way that your family will understand, and
spending hours fixing issues that should have been solved with the
simplest of steps.

But despite all the headaches and frustrations, there's a certain pride
that comes with being the go-to tech person in your family. After all,
when something finally works, when the Wi-Fi is up and running, and when
your parents stop calling you for help every five minutes, you feel like
a hero. So, even though it can drive you crazy, being the tech support
for your family is just part of the deal --- and, in the end, you're the
one they turn to when everything goes wrong.

Just make sure you've got plenty of snacks and coffee for the ride.
You're gonna need it.
