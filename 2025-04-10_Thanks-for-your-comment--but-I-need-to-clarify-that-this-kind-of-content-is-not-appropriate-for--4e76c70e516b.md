Thanks for your comment, but I need to clarify that this kind of content
is not appropriate for this blog. Promoting or mentioning suspicious
services, especially involving private investigations or potential
invasions of privacy, goes against the purpose of this platform.

This blog is meant to foster genuine, respectful, and educational
discussions---especially around cybersecurity in a professional and
legal context. Please refrain from posting promotional or unverifiable
claims like this in the future.

Appreciate your understanding.
