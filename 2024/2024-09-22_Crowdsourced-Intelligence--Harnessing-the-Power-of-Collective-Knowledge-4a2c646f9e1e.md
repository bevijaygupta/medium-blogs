### 1. Introduction to Crowdsourced Intelligence {#26a4 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="26a4"}

Crowdsourcing is the practice of soliciting contributions or input from
a large group of people, particularly from an online community. When
this concept is applied to intelligence gathering, it becomes
*crowdsourced intelligence* --- a collaborative process where
individuals contribute data, analysis, or insight to create a collective
pool of information.

Crowdsourced intelligence leverages the power of distributed human
thinking, enabling the collection of real-time data and insights from
people across different geographies, industries, and backgrounds. This
democratization of knowledge offers a broader, more nuanced perspective
than traditional, centralized intelligence sources.

#### What is Intelligence? {#8925 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="8925"}

In this context, *intelligence* refers to information that is gathered,
processed, and analyzed to aid in decision-making. Intelligence can
relate to various fields, including security, marketing, research, and
policy-making. Crowdsourcing simply adds the dimension of scale, where
the intelligence comes not from a select few but from a vast network of
contributors.

### 2. How Crowdsourced Intelligence Works {#c18d .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="c18d"}

Crowdsourced intelligence works by inviting a large group of
people --- often referred to as the "crowd" --- to contribute to an
ongoing task or project. These contributors can share information,
ideas, data, or insights that are aggregated and analyzed to form
actionable intelligence.

Here's how the process generally works:

1.  [**Defining the Problem or Objective**: An organization or platform
    sets out a specific problem or objective that requires intelligence.
    This could be anything from identifying security threats to
    predicting market trends or gathering citizen input on policy
    decisions.]{#76fb}
2.  [**Engaging the Crowd**: The organization reaches out to a large,
    often diverse, group of individuals. This group can include industry
    experts, regular citizens, freelancers, or even hobbyists, depending
    on the nature of the problem.]{#5e12}
3.  [**Data Collection**: Participants contribute information based on
    their knowledge, observations, or expertise. This can involve
    submitting data, participating in surveys, offering solutions, or
    flagging important events.]{#d63a}
4.  [**Aggregation and Analysis**: The collected data is aggregated and
    processed using either manual methods or automated tools such as
    machine learning or artificial intelligence. Analysis can reveal
    patterns, trends, or anomalies that would be difficult to detect
    using traditional methods.]{#81b0}
5.  [**Decision-Making**: The aggregated intelligence is used to inform
    decisions, whether in business, cybersecurity, governance, or
    research.]{#0ef0}

The beauty of crowdsourced intelligence lies in the diversity of the
crowd. Participants often come from different backgrounds and areas of
expertise, which brings fresh perspectives to the table.
