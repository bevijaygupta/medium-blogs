Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) has become an essential tool in the
modern world of intelligence gathering, investigative journalism,
cybersecurity, and even humanitarian work. OSINT refers to the practice
of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting information from publicly
available sources to gain insights and make informed decisions. Its
power lies in the sheer volume of information freely available online,
which can be analyzed to reveal details about individuals,
organizations, and events.

This article explores several remarkable case studies where OSINT was
successfully used to solve real-world problems. From tracking down
criminals to exposing government corruption, these cases highlight the
potential of OSINT to bring about tangible change.

### 1. Tracking ISIS Fighters via Social Media {#8dd1 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="8dd1"}

In 2015, a social media slip-up by ISIS fighters led to the discovery of
one of their secret training camps in Syria. Members of ISIS had been
sharing photos and videos online, showing themselves in uniform with
recognizable landmarks in the background. These posts were meant to
intimidate and recruit, but they inadvertently provided enough data for
an OSINT investigator to locate them.

An OSINT expert used these images to perform geolocation, a technique
that matches visual elements from photos with known locations. By
examining landmarks, vegetation, and topography, they were able to
narrow down the location to an area in the Syrian desert, near the city
of Raqqa. The process involved overlaying the images on Google Earth and
cross-referencing them with other publicly available satellite images.

#### Techniques Used: {#3707 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="3707"}

- [**Image Metadata Extraction**: Extracting metadata from images often
  reveals the exact GPS coordinates where the photo was taken. While
  many social media platforms strip metadata, this investigator managed
  to find unaltered images on lesser-known platforms.]{#07a4}
- [**Geolocation**: Comparing elements from the photos, such as
  landscape features and building layouts, with Google Earth to confirm
  the location.]{#bbaa}
- [**Cross-Referencing with Social Media Profiles**: By mapping out
  connections between profiles, they could also identify individuals who
  were in the same area, further confirming the location of the
  camp.]{#5404}

#### Impact: {#2545 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--li name="2545"}

This investigation had significant repercussions. Information was shared
with intelligence agencies and helped shape their understanding of ISIS
operations in Syria. It also served as a wake-up call for militant
groups on the vulnerabilities that come with sharing information online.

### 2. Exposing Poachers through Instagram Posts {#9283 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="9283"}

Wildlife poaching is a severe issue in many regions, but one incident in
South Africa brought attention to the ways OSINT could be used to combat
it. A known poacher was boasting about his illegal hunting activities on
Instagram, sharing images of himself with endangered animals. The
Instagram posts, while alarming, provided essential clues that helped
OSINT investigators pinpoint his activities.

By examining the images' backgrounds, they were able to deduce the
approximate location. The investigator used geotag data embedded in the
photos, which often includes coordinates, to narrow down the areas where
the poaching was taking place. Then, by cross-referencing this with
known wildlife preserves, they determined that the poacher was operating
near Kruger National Park.

#### Techniques Used: {#ef7a .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="ef7a"}

- [**Geotag Analysis**: Extracting geotagged data from Instagram posts
  allowed the investigators to identify specific locations.]{#23a1}
- [**Network Analysis**: Identifying the poacher's network by looking at
  tagged friends and accounts that frequently interacted with his
  profile helped uncover others involved in the illegal
  activities.]{#171c}
- [**Social Media Profiling**: Following the poacher's social media
  activity over time provided valuable data, revealing when he was
  active in specific locations.]{#e679}

#### Impact: {#9732 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--li name="9732"}

The investigation was handed over to local authorities, who eventually
apprehended the poacher and his associates. This case underscored how
even casual social media posts could lead to severe consequences,
showing the importance of data privacy.

### 3. Identifying Russian Soldiers in Ukraine {#3480 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="3480"}

Following the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Russia denied deploying
soldiers in Ukraine, but OSINT investigators at Bellingcat uncovered
compelling evidence to the contrary. The team analyzed images posted by
Russian soldiers on social media, many of whom had shared photos that
inadvertently revealed their presence in Ukrainian territory.

Bellingcat utilized image analysis to identify military insignia,
equipment, and even specific units. By studying the landscape in the
photos and matching it to satellite images, they confirmed the soldiers'
locations. In some cases, the soldiers had even shared selfies with
clearly identifiable landmarks, which were verified using tools like
Google Earth.

#### Techniques Used: {#3d8e .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="3d8e"}

- [**Satellite Imagery Analysis**: Using Google Earth and other
  satellite imagery tools, the team matched photos taken by soldiers to
  specific locations.]{#f72a}
- [**Military Equipment Identification**: By cross-referencing the
  weapons and uniforms with Russian military databases, Bellingcat was
  able to identify the soldiers' units.]{#47ee}
- [**Crowdsourced Verification**: Bellingcat encouraged the public to
  help verify the findings, crowdsourcing the investigation and making
  the results more robust.]{#de07}

#### Impact: {#02ae .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--li name="02ae"}

The findings were widely reported, providing undeniable evidence of
Russia's involvement in Ukraine. The investigation also highlighted the
power of OSINT in uncovering truths that governments try to conceal.

### 4. Unmasking a Child Trafficking Network {#2540 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="2540"}

Child trafficking rings often operate in secrecy, but OSINT
investigators from the organization Thorn, co-founded by actress Demi
Moore, have successfully used public data to assist in identifying
trafficking victims and perpetrators. Thorn's investigation techniques
combine web scraping, data analysis, and social media monitoring to
track suspicious activities.

The organization monitors classified ad websites where traffickers often
post ads under euphemisms. By analyzing patterns in these ads and
tracking associated phone numbers and email addresses, Thorn has helped
law enforcement identify and apprehend traffickers. Facial recognition
technology also plays a role in matching photos of trafficked children
with databases of missing persons.

#### Techniques Used: {#fae5 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="fae5"}

- [**Data Aggregation and Analysis**: Thorn collects vast amounts of
  data from classified websites and social media, analyzing it to spot
  patterns indicative of trafficking.]{#469e}
