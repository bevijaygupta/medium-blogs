its adoption, and what the future holds for IoT in this sector.

### 1. Understanding IoT in Construction {#0138 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="0138"}

The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the interconnection of physical
devices --- such as sensors, machines, and vehicles --- that collect and
exchange data over the internet. In the context of construction, IoT
involves integrating these smart devices into construction processes to
improve efficiency, safety, and decision-making. IoT in construction
includes everything from wearable devices that monitor worker health and
safety to sensors embedded in materials that track environmental
conditions and structural integrity.

IoT devices in construction are typically equipped with sensors,
software, and connectivity features that allow them to collect and
transmit data. This data is then processed and analyzed to provide
insights that help construction managers make informed decisions,
optimize workflows, and predict potential issues before they arise. The
use of IoT in construction is becoming increasingly widespread, driven
by the need for greater efficiency, cost savings, and enhanced safety.

### 2. Key Applications of IoT in Construction {#4bfc .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="4bfc"}

IoT's applications in the construction industry are vast and varied,
touching nearly every aspect of the construction process. Here are some
of the key areas where IoT is making a significant impact:

#### 2.1. Construction Site Monitoring and Management {#daf6 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="daf6"}

IoT devices are being used extensively to monitor and manage
construction sites in real time. Sensors placed on-site can track
various parameters such as temperature, humidity, noise levels, and air
