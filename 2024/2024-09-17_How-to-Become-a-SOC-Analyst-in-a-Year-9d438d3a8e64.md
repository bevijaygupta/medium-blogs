### What is a SOC Analyst? {#5184 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="5184"}

A Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst is responsible for monitoring
and protecting an organization's network infrastructure from cyber
threats. They work within a SOC, which is typically a centralized unit
that deals with security issues at both technical and organizational
levels. SOC analysts help identify, analyze, and respond to incidents by
utilizing security tools and threat intelligence.

SOC analysts are vital in preventing data breaches, mitigating attacks,
and ensuring the overall security posture of an organization.
