When evaluating a job opportunity, it's easy to focus on tangible
factors like job title, salary, and benefits. While these are undeniably
important, they don't paint the full picture of what it means to work in
an organization that genuinely values and nurtures its employees.

Workplace culture --- how a company operates, treats its employees, and
fosters an environment of respect and growth --- is a critical component
of job satisfaction and long-term happiness. A great workplace not only
allows you to do your best work but also supports you in being your best
self.

In this blog, we'll dive into the **9 workplace culture green flags**
that signify you've found an amazing place to work. These signs go
beyond the paycheck to show that the organization genuinely cares about
its people and prioritizes their well-being.
