### Introduction to Information Gathering in Cybersecurity {#5aa2 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="5aa2"}

In cybersecurity, information gathering --- often referred to as
reconnaissance or OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) gathering --- is the
process of collecting data about targets or networks before launching
any further action. Information gathering involves acquiring as much
relevant information as possible without alerting the target, helping
cybersecurity professionals map out potential vulnerabilities and
understand the environment they are tasked with securing.

There are two main types of information gathering:

1.  [**Passive Reconnaissance**: Gathering information without direct
    interaction with the target. This includes methods like WHOIS
    lookups, public record searches, and using various OSINT
    tools.]{#6b17}
2.  [**Active Reconnaissance**: Gathering information that involves
    interacting with the target directly, such as scanning IP addresses
    or checking for open ports. Active reconnaissance can reveal deeper
    insights but also risks detection by the target's security
    systems.]{#779c}

Mastering both passive and active techniques is essential for
cybersecurity professionals. Let's take a closer look at the powerful
tools that facilitate these activities.
