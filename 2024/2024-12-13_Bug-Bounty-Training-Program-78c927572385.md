In the digital age, where businesses are rapidly shifting online,
security is paramount. Ethical hacking --- especially through bug bounty
programs --- has become a sought-after skill. This blog will guide you
through a comprehensive online **Bug Bounty Training Program** designed
to turn you into a proficient web application penetration tester (WAPT).
Here's what you'll learn:
