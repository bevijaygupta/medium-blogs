Fraudulent international calls have become a growing concern in the
digital age. Scammers use deceptive techniques to lure unsuspecting
individuals into revealing personal information, making payments, or
compromising their security. To combat this rising threat, the Indian
Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has introduced a new feature in
the **Sanchar Saathi portal** under the **Chakshu module**. This
initiative empowers citizens to report international fraud calls,
thereby fostering a more secure and accountable telecommunications
environment.

This blog explores the significance of this facility, how it works, its
benefits, and its role in enhancing cybersecurity and digital hygiene.

### Understanding the Sanchar Saathi Portal and the Chakshu Module {#8ff8 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="8ff8"}

### What is the Sanchar Saathi Portal? {#d517 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--h3 name="d517"}

The **Sanchar Saathi Portal** is an initiative by the Department of
Telecommunications (DoT) aimed at ensuring security, transparency, and
user empowerment in the telecom sector. The portal provides several
tools and services to help users verify their telecom connections,
prevent SIM misuse, and report fraudulent activities.

Key features of the Sanchar Saathi Portal include:

- [**TAFCOP** (Telecom Analytics for Fraud Management and Consumer
  Protection): Allows users to verify the number of SIMs issued in their
  name.]{#1237}
- [**Chakshu Module**: Focuses on tackling telecom-related fraud by
  enabling users to report and block suspicious activities.]{#952d}

### What is the Chakshu Module? {#b6df .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="b6df"}

The **Chakshu Module** is an integral component of the Sanchar Saathi
portal, dedicated to combating frauds in the telecom ecosystem. The term
"Chakshu," meaning "eye" in Sanskrit, symbolizes vigilance and security.
It serves as a centralized mechanism for monitoring, reporting, and
mitigating fraudulent telecom activities, including phishing attempts,
spoofed calls, and international scam calls.

### The Need for Reporting International Fraud Calls {#c23d .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="c23d"}

### The Rising Threat of International Fraud Calls {#3797 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--h3 name="3797"}

International fraud calls often originate from scam centers abroad,
exploiting vulnerable individuals through:

1.  [**Tech Support Scams**: Callers pose as representatives from
    reputed companies, such as Microsoft or Apple, and claim that the
    user's device has been compromised.]{#8c6b}
2.  [**Lottery or Prize Scams**: Callers inform victims that they have
    won a significant sum of money and demand a fee to claim the
    prize.]{#5e75}
3.  [**Banking Scams**: Fraudsters impersonate bank officials and
    request sensitive financial information.]{#da12}
4.  [**One Ring Scams**: Missed calls are made from international
    numbers to entice victims into calling back, leading to hefty call
    charges.]{#e75f}

These scams often result in financial losses, data breaches, and
emotional distress for victims.

### Challenges in Addressing International Fraud Calls {#1842 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="1842"}

- [**Lack of Awareness**: Many individuals are unaware of how to
  identify or report fraud calls.]{#2787}
- [**Jurisdictional Issues**: Scams originating from foreign countries
  make enforcement and accountability challenging.]{#80e4}
- [**Evolving Techniques**: Scammers continuously adapt their methods to
  evade detection.]{#a28a}

Recognizing these challenges, the Chakshu module provides an efficient
and user-friendly way to report such calls.

### How the Chakshu Module Works {#0afb .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="0afb"}

### Step 1: Accessing the Portal {#a376 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--h3 name="a376"}

To report a fraud call, users must visit the **Sanchar Saathi portal**
at
[https://www.sancharsaathi.gov.in](https://www.sancharsaathi.gov.in){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://www.sancharsaathi.gov.in"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}.

### Step 2: Navigating to the Chakshu Module {#2816 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="2816"}

On the portal's homepage, users can find the **Chakshu Module**. It is
specifically designed for reporting suspicious activities, including
international fraud calls.

### Step 3: Filing a Complaint {#6fb7 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="6fb7"}

Users can file a complaint by:

- [Entering details such as the caller's number, the time of the call,
  and a brief description of the scam attempt.]{#afef}
- [Uploading any supporting evidence, such as call recordings or
  screenshots of text messages.]{#e534}

### Step 4: Verification and Action {#97f9 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="97f9"}

The reported information is verified by the relevant authorities. If the
report is valid:

- [The fraudulent number may be blocked to prevent further
  misuse.]{#d892}
- [The case is escalated to cybersecurity or law enforcement agencies
  for further investigation.]{#e621}

safeguarding themselves and others from fraud. By reporting suspicious
calls, users contribute to a safer telecom environment.

### 2. Deterrence for Scammers {#6f5f .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="6f5f"}

A centralized reporting mechanism increases the risk of detection for
scammers, discouraging them from targeting Indian citizens.

### How to Identify International Fraud Calls {#4e31 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="4e31"}

Recognizing the signs of a fraud call is crucial. Here are some red
flags:

1.  [**Unsolicited Calls**: Calls from unknown international numbers

    ask for sensitive details like OTPs, passwords, or bank account
    numbers over the phone.]{#a97e}
4.  [**Too Good to Be True Offers**: Claims of winning prizes or
    lotteries that seem unrealistic.]{#82ed}
5.  [**Unusual Call Charges**: Calls that result in exorbitant charges
    upon answering or returning the call.]{#1b6f}
