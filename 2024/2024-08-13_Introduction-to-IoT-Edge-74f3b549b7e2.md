### Understanding IoT Edge Computing {#a4de .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="a4de"}

### What is IoT Edge? {#3315 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--h3 name="3315"}

IoT Edge refers to the practice of processing and analyzing data at or
near the location where it is generated, rather than relying solely on
cloud-based systems. In a traditional IoT architecture, data from
connected devices is typically sent to a centralized cloud server for
processing, storage, and analysis. However, as the volume of data
generated by IoT devices continues to surge, this approach can lead to
several challenges, including high latency, increased bandwidth
consumption, and potential security risks.

IoT Edge computing addresses these challenges by distributing
computational resources closer to the devices at the "edge" of the
network. This means that data can be processed locally on edge devices
or edge servers, enabling real-time insights and actions without the
need to transmit all data to the cloud. Edge computing is particularly
valuable in scenarios where low latency, real-time decision-making, and
data privacy are critical.

### Key Components of IoT Edge Architecture {#ec6e .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="ec6e"}

The IoT Edge architecture consists of several key components that work
