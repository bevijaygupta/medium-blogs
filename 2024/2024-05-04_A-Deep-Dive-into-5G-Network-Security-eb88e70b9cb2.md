    as hypervisor attacks, VM escape exploits, and orchestration
    vulnerabilities. Securing virtualized network functions (VNFs) and
    orchestrators is critical to mitigating these risks.]{#39e0}
2.  [**Network Slicing Security:** Network slicing introduces
    complexities related to isolation, resource allocation, and
    management, raising concerns about unauthorized access, data
    leakage, and cross-slice interference. Implementing robust
    segmentation, access control, and encryption mechanisms is essential
    to secure network slices effectively.]{#d17d}
3.  [**Authentication and Identity Management:** With the proliferation
    of connected devices and IoT endpoints in 5G networks, ensuring
    secure authentication and identity management becomes paramount.
    Weak authentication mechanisms, compromised credentials, and
    identity spoofing attacks pose significant risks to network security
    and integrity.]{#05ca}
4.  [**Privacy Concerns:** 5G networks facilitate the collection and
    processing of vast amounts of user data, raising privacy concerns
    regarding the unauthorized use, disclosure, and exploitation of
    personal information. Adhering to privacy regulations, implementing
    data anonymization techniques, and adopting privacy-enhancing
    technologies are essential to safeguard user privacy in 5G
