### What is Ethical Hacking? {#9dbd .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="9dbd"}

Ethical hacking is the practice of intentionally penetrating systems,
networks, and applications to discover vulnerabilities and weaknesses.
Unlike malicious hackers who exploit these vulnerabilities for personal
gain or to cause harm, ethical hackers use their skills to improve
security measures and protect against potential cyber threats. Ethical
hacking is often conducted with the permission and knowledge of the
system owner, ensuring that it is carried out legally and ethically.
