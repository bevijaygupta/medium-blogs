### 1. Pre-Engagement Interactions {#4f26 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="4f26"}

Every penetration test begins with pre-engagement interactions, where
the scope and objectives of the test are defined. Here's what you'll
learn:

- [**Understanding Client Requirements**: Learn to identify client
  expectations, define goals, and establish the type of
  test --- black-box, gray-box, or white-box.]{#b963}
- [**Legal and Compliance Considerations**: Gain insights into
  regulatory requirements, including NDAs, authorization forms, and data
  privacy laws to ensure ethical and legal compliance.]{#c0ea}
- [**Scoping and Planning**: Define the scope of testing, including what
  assets are in scope, and plan testing activities while estimating
  timelines and resources required.]{#7c18}
- [**Defining Rules of Engagement**: Establish guidelines on permissible
  testing activities, safe hours for testing, and incident response
  protocols if issues arise during the test.]{#2237}

Effective pre-engagement interactions set the groundwork for a
successful penetration test by ensuring alignment between the tester and
client's expectations.
