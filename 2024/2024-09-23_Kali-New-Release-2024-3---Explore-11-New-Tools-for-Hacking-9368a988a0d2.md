### 11 New Tools in Kali 2024.3 for Hacking and Penetration Testing {#3fdd .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="3fdd"}

Kali Linux is known for its vast collection of pre-installed tools for
security assessments. In Kali 2024.3, several new tools have been
introduced to assist in different aspects of cybersecurity, ranging from
network scanning to social engineering. Let's dive into each one:

### 1. Photon: {#24e5 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="24e5"}

Photon is a lightning-fast web crawler designed for OSINT (Open Source
Intelligence) purposes. It efficiently gathers URLs, social media links,
emails, and more from target websites. Unlike traditional crawlers,
Photon is smart enough to extract crucial intelligence data with speed
and accuracy.

**Use Case**: Photon is invaluable for gathering intelligence from a
target's online presence. Penetration testers can use Photon for initial
reconnaissance before diving deeper into vulnerability assessments.

### 2. Sherlock: {#ba2b .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="ba2b"}

Sherlock is a powerful tool for finding usernames across multiple social
media platforms. It allows hackers to quickly check the availability of
a username and find associated profiles across platforms like Twitter,
Facebook, Instagram, and more.

**Use Case**: Sherlock is perfect for social engineering attacks and
reconnaissance. Security professionals can also use Sherlock to track
down fake profiles, impersonators, or investigate threat actors during
an engagement.

### 3. Fierce2: {#6cf5 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="6cf5"}

Fierce2 is an upgraded version of the popular DNS enumeration tool,
designed to help in finding potential subdomains of a target. It's
particularly useful in discovering hidden services that may not be
immediately apparent from the target's main domain.

**Use Case**: By discovering subdomains, a penetration tester can
uncover additional entry points into a network that might not be as
secure as the main website.

### 4. Brutespray: {#6623 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="6623"}

Brutespray combines the power of brute force attacks with Nmap. Once
you've scanned a target with Nmap and found open ports, Brutespray can
automatically launch a brute-force attack on those services using
credentials lists.

**Use Case**: Brutespray is effective in finding weak or default
credentials in services like SSH, FTP, and MySQL. It helps in automating
the brute-force process, saving time in large-scale engagements.

### 5. Findomain: {#8ff8 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="8ff8"}

Findomain is a fast and efficient tool for domain discovery. It helps
hackers and security professionals discover all domains associated with
a target organization, even those that are not well-advertised.

**Use Case**: Ideal for reconnaissance, Findomain quickly enumerates
domains, which could reveal forgotten or misconfigured web services
within an organization's attack surface.

SniffAir is an advanced wireless network analysis tool designed for
pentesters looking to assess wireless security. It can passively monitor
and capture traffic, discover hidden wireless networks, and even crack
weak encryption methods.

**Use Case**: SniffAir is ideal for Wi-Fi security assessments, allowing
you to test how secure a network is and whether weak protocols like WEP
or WPA can be exploited.

This tool performs advanced email enumeration and validation.
SocialPwned is particularly useful in finding social media accounts,
online profiles, and services associated with specific email addresses.

**Use Case**: SocialPwned is a crucial tool for social engineers and
security researchers looking to investigate email leakage or linked
accounts that could be leveraged for attacks.

### 11. DockerScan: {#c124 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="c124"}

DockerScan is designed to help with auditing Docker container
environments, checking for misconfigurations or vulnerabilities. Given
the widespread use of containerization, this tool is crucial for
auditing modern infrastructures.

**Use Case**: As Docker adoption continues to grow in the enterprise
world, DockerScan helps pentesters and auditors ensure that container
environments are properly secured and free from vulnerabilities.

### Using the New Tools for Penetration Testing {#8d40 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="8d40"}

Now that you're familiar with the new tools, let's discuss how these can
be combined in an effective penetration testing methodology.

1.  [**Reconnaissance**: Tools like **Photon**, **Findomain**, and
    **Sherlock** are essential in the initial stages of reconnaissance.
    Use them to gather as much open-source intelligence (OSINT) about
    the target as possible, including subdomains, usernames, emails, and
    associated services.]{#b28f}
2.  [**Enumeration**: Once you have gathered sufficient intelligence,
    **Fierce2** can help you dig deeper by identifying subdomains and
    DNS-related information. This can expose hidden services that may
    not be protected as thoroughly as the main site.]{#daaf}
3.  [**Brute Force and Attack**: After discovering exposed services with
    tools like **Brutespray**, you can launch brute-force attacks on
    weak credentials, aiming to gain access to services like SSH or
    FTP.]{#aab5}
4.  [**Wireless Attacks**: If Wi-Fi is in scope, **SniffAir** is a great
    option to assess the security of wireless networks and even crack
    weak encryption methods.]{#22c9}
5.  [**Advanced Social Engineering**: **SocialPwned** allows penetration
    testers to dig into email associations and discover additional
    attack vectors related to social media or compromised email
    accounts.]{#0861}
6.  [**Event Log Analysis**: If you're doing a post-exploitation
    assessment on a compromised system, **Chainsaw** makes the process
    of analyzing Windows event logs much easier, helping you spot
    suspicious or malicious activities in the logs.]{#2497}
7.  [**RFID Testing**: Physical pentesters will find **Proxmark3**
    invaluable for assessing the security of RFID systems, whether it's
    gaining unauthorized access to buildings or other restricted
    areas.]{#9c38}
8.  [**Network Analysis**: If network traffic analysis is part of your
    test, **Zeek** provides a powerful framework for monitoring and
    inspecting traffic for threats or anomalies.]{#087b}
9.  [**Container Security**: In modern environments, assessing container
    security is a must. **DockerScan** helps auditors and security
    experts ensure that containers are free from vulnerabilities and
    misconfigurations.]{#025b}
