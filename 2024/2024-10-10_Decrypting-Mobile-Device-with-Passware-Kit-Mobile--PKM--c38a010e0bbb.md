In today's digital age, our lives are closely linked with our devices,
which hold precious memories, important documents, and personal
information. The sudden death of a loved one can leave families not only
in emotional turmoil but also struggling to access crucial information
stored on these devices. Recently, we had the opportunity to provide
support and relief to a grieving family by unlocking their deceased
relative's phone using Passware Kit Mobile (PKM) --- Forensic tool that
extracts and decrypts user data from mobile devices.

When the family approached us, they were in a state of distress. They
were unable to unlock their loved one's phone and feared that vital
information and cherished memories might be lost forever. Understanding
the sensitivity and urgency of the situation, our team at Einitial24
immediately decided to help, driven by the simple desire to support the
family during this difficult time.

The phone was initially off, with the battery completely drained. After
charging it, we discovered that the device was secured with a four-digit
PIN. Our first step was to identify the phone model using Google and
Google Lens. Once confirmed, we used Passware Kit Mobile (PKM) to crack
the PIN.

The process involved connecting the phone to PKM and selecting the
appropriate phone model. Following the provided instructions, we placed
the phone in Boot ROM mode, allowing the software to detect it. The next
step was to take a dump of the phone's data in encrypted form. PKM then
prompted us to choose a password-cracking method, such as Bruteforce,
Dictionary, or Xieve, all of which are available in the software. Given
the four-digit PIN, the complete process took approximately 1 hour and
we were able to crack the password in two minutes time, all with the
help of enhanced functionalities and capabilities of State-of-the-art
mobile forensic tool by Passware which is used by the world's top Law
Enforcement Agencies to crack cases where decryption is required.
