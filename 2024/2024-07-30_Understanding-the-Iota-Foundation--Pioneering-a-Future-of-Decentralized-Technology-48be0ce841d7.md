the future of decentralized technology.

**Origins of the Iota Foundation**

The Iota Foundation was established by David Sønstebø, Dominik Schiener,
Sergey Ivancheglo, and Serguei Popov. Their vision was to create a new
kind of decentralized ledger that would address the limitations of
traditional blockchain technology, such as scalability, transaction
fees, and energy consumption. They introduced the Iota Tangle, a
Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that enables feeless transactions and
scalable network growth.

The Foundation was officially incorporated as a non-profit organization
in Germany, with the goal of promoting the development and adoption of
the Iota technology. It aims to build a trustless, permissionless
ecosystem that fosters innovation and supports the growth of the
Internet of Things (IoT).

**Core Technology: The Iota Tangle**

At the heart of the Iota Foundation's work is the Iota Tangle. Unlike
traditional blockchains, the Tangle is a DAG, which allows for a more
scalable and efficient network. Here are some of the key features of the
Iota Tangle:

**Scalability**

The Tangle's structure allows for infinite scalability. As more devices

especially for microtransactions. With Iota, users do not need to pay
any fees, making it ideal for IoT applications where devices frequently
exchange small amounts of data and value.

**Quantum Resistance**

The Iota Tangle is designed with future-proofing in mind. It
incorporates quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms to protect
against potential threats from quantum computing. This ensures that the
network remains secure even as technology advances.

**Decentralization**

The Tangle promotes true decentralization by requiring each participant
to validate two previous transactions before their own transaction can
be confirmed. This process, known as "Proof of Work," ensures that the
network remains secure and resilient without relying on miners or
central authorities.

**Key Initiatives and Projects**

The Iota Foundation is involved in numerous projects and initiatives
aimed at advancing decentralized technology and fostering the adoption
