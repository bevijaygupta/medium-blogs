In the ever-evolving world of public speaking and presentation, true
leadership goes beyond merely captivating an audience or commanding
attention on a stage. As a speaker or presenter, you have the
opportunity to be a leader in a profound way, one that goes beyond
personal recognition. Your influence as a leader isn't demonstrated by
being the loudest voice in the room, but by seeing potential in others
and helping them unlock it.

This type of leadership is what shapes true success, both for you and
for those around you. As we explore the idea of leadership in public
speaking, let's unpack some core principles that elevate you as a
speaker and allow you to lift others along the way.

### Leadership is Simple: Lift Others Up {#0041 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="0041"}

When people think of public speakers or presenters, they often imagine
someone with a magnetic presence, charisma, and perhaps a touch of
self-assuredness. While these qualities are useful, they don't define
what makes a speaker truly great. To me, leadership is simple: it's
about lifting others up.

As a speaker, lifting others involves more than delivering inspiring
words. It requires genuinely understanding your audience, identifying
their needs, and empowering them with knowledge and encouragement. In
every interaction with an audience, you have the chance to inspire
growth, open minds, and spark ideas. This is where the heart of
leadership lies: in helping others reach their potential.

For instance, if you're delivering a workshop on public speaking skills,
true leadership isn't just about showing off your expertise. It's about
making sure participants walk away feeling empowered, equipped with new
tools, and ready to grow.

### It's Not About Being the Loudest in the Room {#1205 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="1205"}

Being a loud speaker may draw initial attention, but it doesn't create
lasting impact. True leadership in public speaking is about finding your
voice and using it in ways that are authentic, genuine, and meaningful
to your audience. It's not about asserting dominance or overshadowing
others, but rather, creating a space where everyone feels seen, heard,
and valued.

In this way, leadership becomes an act of service rather than
self-promotion. Rather than striving to be the loudest, seek to be the
most impactful. Ask yourself, "How can I make my message resonate in a
way that truly benefits my audience?" When you focus on delivering
content that serves, you'll find that people are naturally drawn to
you --- not because you're loud, but because you're resonant and
relevant.

### Seeing Potential in Others and Helping Them Thrive {#bbc1 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="bbc1"}

One of the hallmarks of effective leadership is the ability to see
potential in others, even when they may not see it in themselves. As a
public speaker, you're often in a position to mentor or guide others who
want to follow a similar path. Look for opportunities to encourage
aspiring speakers, offer them advice, and give them the confidence to
believe in their own voice.

When you share the stage or mentor someone in the art of public
speaking, you're not only helping them to grow but also fostering a
culture of mutual respect and trust. By investing in the growth of
others, you solidify your own place as a leader. Leadership is shown
through the growth and development of those you've impacted along the
way. Each time you help someone else thrive, you strengthen your own
legacy as a speaker.

For example, imagine you're running a speaking engagement at a
conference, and there's a new speaker who's nervous about presenting.
Taking time to give them tips, reassurance, or even a quick pep talk can
have a profound impact on their confidence. When you help others thrive,
you create a ripple effect that extends far beyond your immediate
circle.

### True Leadership is Shown Through Your Team's Growth {#4a30 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="4a30"}

In any leadership role, but especially as a public speaker, it's
essential to view success as a collective journey. Rather than seeing
yourself as the "star," consider yourself part of a larger team that
includes your audience, fellow speakers, and collaborators. By promoting
a culture of growth and shared success, you help elevate everyone
involved.

For instance, if you're a speaker leading a workshop series, celebrate
the small wins of your participants. Recognize their progress, applaud
their improvements, and let them know how far they've come. When you see
your audience or mentees achieving success, you're witnessing the impact
of your leadership firsthand.

Remember, leadership isn't about claiming credit. It's about fostering
an environment where everyone has the opportunity to shine. When you
encourage your audience or fellow presenters to share their
achievements, it sets the stage for a supportive atmosphere where growth
is encouraged and celebrated.

### Celebrate Your Team's Wins, Big or Small {#15cd .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="15cd"}

Every milestone counts, no matter how small it may seem. One of the most
impactful ways to practice leadership as a speaker is to celebrate the
successes of others, whether it's a participant who overcame stage
fright or someone who aced a presentation with skills they learned from
you.

Celebrating these victories doesn't only boost morale but also
strengthens the connection between you and your audience. When people
feel seen and appreciated, they're more motivated to continue pushing
their limits. Even a small acknowledgment can go a long way. By
highlighting these achievements, you reinforce a culture of growth and
gratitude within your community.

For example, if you're running a presentation skills training and
someone has just completed their first confident delivery, take a moment
to acknowledge it. This positive reinforcement is more than a
compliment; it's a validation of their hard work and an encouragement to
keep going.

### When Others Win, You Win {#0851 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="0851"}

In leadership, there is a principle that's often overlooked but
incredibly powerful: when others win, you win. By helping others achieve
success, you contribute to a thriving ecosystem where everyone has the
potential to succeed. As a speaker, your success is magnified by the
success of those you've inspired or helped along the way.

Think of this as a cycle: when you empower someone to achieve their
goals, they often become your advocates, followers, or partners in
future endeavors. Your impact grows as your network of inspired
individuals expands. Leadership, then, becomes a continuous loop of
growth, support, and shared success.

### Share Success, Believe in People, Encourage Growth {#7133 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="7133"}

These three pillars --- sharing success, believing in people, and
encouraging growth --- are the foundation of a great leader in public
speaking. By sharing success, you create a culture of collaboration
rather than competition. When you believe in people, you give them the
confidence to believe in themselves. And by encouraging growth, you
inspire them to pursue their potential relentlessly.

Here are practical ways to embody these principles as a speaker:

1.  [**Share success:** If you have a team or audience members who
    contributed to a project or event, openly acknowledge their roles.
    This shows humility and reinforces the idea that success is a group
    effort.]{#4bd6}
2.  [**Believe in people:** Speak to the strengths of your audience. Use
    examples, stories, or anecdotes that highlight how they too can
    achieve greatness.]{#be6d}
3.  [**Encourage growth:** Offer concrete resources, actionable tips, or
    next steps that enable your audience to continue growing even after
    they leave your session.]{#d340}

### Celebrate Progress {#c4b3 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="c4b3"}

Celebrating progress is an essential aspect of leadership that fosters
motivation and momentum. Whether someone is just starting their journey
or they're making strides toward advanced skills, each step forward is
worth acknowledging. Progress isn't always linear, but by celebrating
it, you remind your audience (and yourself) that growth is an ongoing
journey.

If you're hosting a series of sessions, make it a point to celebrate the
progress of participants at each stage. This could mean recognizing
someone's improvement in speaking confidence, applauding their ability
to communicate complex ideas, or simply acknowledging their commitment
to learning. Progress is progress, no matter the pace.

### Leadership is a Superpower {#3a47 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="3a47"}

At its core, leadership is about harnessing a unique set of skills,
including empathy, insight, and integrity, to make a lasting impact on
others. As a speaker, you have a platform --- a superpower that allows
you to influence, inspire, and uplift people from all walks of life. Use
this superpower wisely.

A leader with this superpower understands that true success comes not
from personal accolades, but from the success of those they've
influenced. When you inspire others to take charge of their own
journeys, you're helping them realize their potential, which in turn,
reinforces your own purpose and impact as a speaker.

### When You Lift Others, You Rise Too {#9158 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="9158"}

The most rewarding aspect of leadership is this: when you lift others,
you rise too. In a field where competition and self-promotion often take
center stage, choosing to lift others up sets you apart. The
relationships you build and the lives you touch are what truly define
your legacy.

As a public speaker and presenter, remember that your role isn't just to
speak but to inspire, uplift, and empower. Help others reach their
potential, and in doing so, you'll find that you're constantly growing,
evolving, and reaching new heights yourself.

### Conclusion: Help Others Reach Their Potential --- and You'll Reach Yours {#aa48 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="aa48"}

In a world that often glorifies individual achievement, the true mark of
success lies in the ability to elevate others. As a public speaker, your
role isn't limited to the words you share on stage. It's about inspiring
growth, fostering community, and championing the success of others. By
helping others reach their potential, you're not only enhancing their
journey but also unlocking your own.

So, as you step onto that stage, remember that leadership in speaking is
about more than just delivering a message. It's about using your
platform to lift others, encourage growth, and build a legacy rooted in
collective success. When you embody this approach, you'll find that your
impact resonates far beyond the stage, leaving a lasting influence that
continues to grow over time.
