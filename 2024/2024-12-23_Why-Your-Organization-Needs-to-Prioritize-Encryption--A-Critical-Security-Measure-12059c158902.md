data vulnerable to unauthorized access.

This blog explores why encryption is critical for your organization, how
it works, and best practices for leveraging encryption to safeguard
sensitive information.

### Understanding Encryption {#0810 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="0810"}

Encryption is the process of converting data into a format that is
unreadable to unauthorized individuals. It ensures that even if data is
intercepted, it remains secure and indecipherable without the proper
decryption key. Modern encryption algorithms are designed to provide
robust protection, enabling organizations to secure sensitive
information across multiple platforms and devices.

### Types of Encryption {#e1fa .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="e1fa"}

**Symmetric Encryption:**

- [Utilizes a single key for both encryption and decryption.]{#1ebd}
- [Fast and efficient, but key distribution can be a challenge.]{#cdb3}
- [Example: Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).]{#5aa9}

**Asymmetric Encryption:**

- [Uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key
  for decryption.]{#e439}
- [Often used in secure communication protocols.]{#74e5}
- [Example: RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman).]{#f86c}

**Hashing:**

- [Converts data into a fixed-size hash value, which is
  irreversible.]{#88bf}
- [Commonly used for verifying data integrity.]{#7a1d}
- [Example: SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm).]{#08c8}
