In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, staying ahead of
malicious actors requires a deep understanding of both offensive and
defensive techniques. For ethical hackers and cybersecurity
professionals, mastery of hacking tools is essential for identifying
vulnerabilities, assessing risks, and fortifying defenses. In the latest
iteration of the [Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)
program](https://einitial24.com/ethical-hacking-course/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://einitial24.com/ethical-hacking-course/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, version 13 (v13) with Ai, participants
are introduced to a comprehensive arsenal of tools spanning various
phases of ethical hacking. In this guide, we'll delve into the top tools
covered in CEH v13 with Ai, organized by their respective categories.

### Understanding Hacking Tools {#4046 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="4046"}

#### What are Hacking Tools? {#1eb4 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--h3 name="1eb4"}

Hacking tools, also known as penetration testing tools, are software
applications designed to assist cybersecurity professionals in assessing
the security posture of systems, networks, and applications. These tools
encompass a wide range of functionalities, including reconnaissance,
scanning, exploitation, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration.
While some hacking tools are open-source and freely available, others
are proprietary and may require licensing or subscription fees.
Regardless of their origin, hacking tools serve as indispensable assets
for ethical hackers seeking to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in
digital environments.

### Top CEH v12 Tools {#9ab9 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="9ab9"}

#### Reconnaissance/Footprinting Tools {#7651 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--h3 name="7651"}

Reconnaissance, also known as footprinting, is the first phase of
ethical hacking, involving gathering information about a target system
or organization. In CEH v12, participants are introduced to several
reconnaissance tools, including:

1.  [**Nmap:** A versatile network scanning tool used for port scanning,
    service enumeration, and OS fingerprinting.]{#e79e}
2.  [**Recon-NG:** A powerful reconnaissance framework that automates
    the gathering of information from open-source intelligence (OSINT)
    sources, social media platforms, and public databases.]{#b6f1}
3.  [**Shodan:** A search engine for internet-connected devices, Shodan
    enables users to discover vulnerable systems, industrial control
    systems (ICS), and Internet of Things (IoT) devices exposed to the
    internet.]{#a36f}

#### Scanning Tools {#ce8c .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--li name="ce8c"}

Scanning tools are used to identify vulnerabilities and
misconfigurations in target systems, networks, and applications. CEH v12
covers several scanning tools, including:

1.  [**OpenVAS:** An open-source vulnerability scanner that performs
    comprehensive scans for known vulnerabilities in systems and
    networks.]{#8f55}
2.  [**Nessus:** A widely-used vulnerability assessment tool that scans
    networks for security vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and
    compliance violations.]{#8edd}
3.  [**Nikto:** A web server scanner that identifies common
    vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in web applications, including
    outdated software versions, insecure directories, and server
    misconfigurations.]{#fdf2}

#### Gaining Access Tools {#3a59 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--li name="3a59"}

Gaining access tools are used to exploit vulnerabilities and gain
unauthorized access to target systems, networks, and applications. CEH
v12 introduces participants to various exploitation tools, including:

1.  [**Metasploit Framework:** A widely-used penetration testing
    framework that provides a repository of exploits, payloads, and
    auxiliary modules for exploiting vulnerabilities in systems and
    applications.]{#0b0a}
2.  [**SQLMap:** A tool for detecting and exploiting SQL injection
    vulnerabilities in web applications, enabling attackers to retrieve
    sensitive information from databases.]{#2399}
3.  [**Hydra:** A fast and flexible password-cracking tool that supports
    various protocols, including HTTP, FTP, SSH, and SMB, for performing
    brute-force attacks against authentication mechanisms.]{#1b63}

#### Maintaining Access Tools {#6c8f .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--li name="6c8f"}

Maintaining access tools are used to establish persistent access to
compromised systems, networks, and applications. In CEH v12,
participants learn about various post-exploitation tools, including:

1.  [**Netcat (nc):** A versatile networking utility that can be used to
    create reverse shells, transfer files, and establish encrypted
    connections between attacker and victim systems.]{#3613}
2.  [**Meterpreter:** A post-exploitation payload included in the
    Metasploit Framework, Meterpreter provides a powerful
    command-and-control interface for interacting with compromised
    systems, executing commands, and exfiltrating data.]{#9f33}
3.  [**PowerShell Empire:** A post-exploitation framework that leverages
    PowerShell for establishing and maintaining persistent access to
    compromised Windows systems, enabling attackers to deploy agents,
    escalate privileges, and evade detection.]{#50c4}

#### Clearing Tracks Tools {#886d .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--li name="886d"}

Clearing tracks tools are used to cover the attacker's tracks and erase
evidence of unauthorized access from target systems, networks, and
applications. CEH v12 includes several tools for clearing tracks,
including:

1.  [**CCleaner:** A disk cleanup utility that removes temporary files,
    browsing history, cookies, and other traces of user activity from
    Windows systems, helping attackers cover their tracks and evade
    detection.]{#9331}
2.  [**Windows Event Viewer:** A built-in Windows utility for viewing
    and analyzing event logs, including security logs, system logs, and
    application logs, to identify and remove evidence of unauthorized
    access and malicious activity.]{#ffed}
3.  [**BleachBit:** An open-source disk cleanup tool similar to
    CCleaner, BleachBit removes temporary files, cache files, and other
    unnecessary data from Linux and Windows systems, aiding attackers in
    covering their tracks and maintaining stealth.]{#8354}

#### Other Miscellaneous Tools {#5ce1 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--li name="5ce1"}

In addition to the aforementioned categories, CEH v13 with Ai covers a
variety of other miscellaneous tools that are essential for ethical
hacking and penetration testing, including:

1.  [**Wireshark:** A powerful network protocol analyzer that captures
    and analyzes network traffic in real-time, enabling attackers to
    sniff sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and
    session cookies, transmitted over unencrypted protocols.]{#c0cd}
2.  [**Burp Suite:** A comprehensive web application security testing
    tool that includes a proxy, scanner, intruder, repeater, sequencer,
    and decoder for identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in web
    applications, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL
    injection.]{#fcc4}
3.  [**Aircrack-ng:** A suite of wireless network security tools for
    assessing the security of Wi-Fi networks, including packet sniffing,
    packet injection, and brute-force attacks against WEP and WPA/WPA2
    encryption keys.]{#b0b7}
