### 1. Overview of Digital Forensics {#530c .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="530c"}

Digital forensics involves the identification, preservation, analysis,
and presentation of electronic data for use in legal cases,
cybersecurity incidents, or internal investigations. Key branches of
digital forensics include:

- [**Computer Forensics:** Focuses on recovering data from
  computers.]{#c453}
- [**Mobile Forensics:** Deals with data extraction from mobile
  devices.]{#d90e}
- [**Network Forensics:** Concentrates on monitoring and analyzing
  network traffic.]{#abeb}
- [**Memory Forensics:** Involves examining volatile data stored in
  RAM.]{#c69d}
- [**Cloud Forensics:** Covers investigations within cloud computing
  environments.]{#c87b}

Each branch demands specialized tools tailored to its unique challenges.
