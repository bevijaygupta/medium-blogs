``` {#bf6a .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p .graf--preV2 code-block-mode="1" spellcheck="false" code-block-lang="sql"}
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

The `apt update`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} command fetches the list
of available updates, while the `apt upgrade`{.markup--code
.markup--p-code} command installs them.

### 5.2 Dist-upgrade vs Full-upgrade: What's the Difference? {#5118 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="5118"}

When managing updates, you may encounter different commands such as
`dist-upgrade`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} and
`full-upgrade`{.markup--code .markup--p-code}. Here's what they mean:

- [**`dist-upgrade`{.markup--code .markup--li-code}**: This command not
  only upgrades existing packages but also handles dependencies
  intelligently. It can remove obsolete packages and install new
  ones.]{#aa9f}
- [`sudo apt dist-upgrade`{.markup--code .markup--li-code}]{#51a9}
- [**`full-upgrade`{.markup--code .markup--li-code}**: This command is
  synonymous with `dist-upgrade`{.markup--code .markup--li-code} in Kali
  Linux, ensuring that all packages and dependencies are handled
  correctly.]{#fc51}
- [`sudo apt full-upgrade`{.markup--code .markup--li-code}]{#9dbc}
