**Introduction:**

In today's digital age, social media platforms like Facebook have become
an integral part of our lives. With billions of users worldwide,
Facebook serves as a hub for communication, networking, and sharing
information. However, like any online platform, Facebook is not immune
to security threats, including hacking.

**Understanding Facebook Hacking:**

Facebook hacking involves gaining unauthorized access to someone's
Facebook account or bypassing its security measures. It can range from
simple password guessing to sophisticated phishing attacks or exploiting
vulnerabilities in Facebook's system. While hacking is often associated
with malicious intent, there are ethical hacking practices aimed at
identifying and fixing security loopholes to enhance online safety.

**Ethical Hacking vs. Illegal Hacking:**

It's crucial to distinguish between ethical hacking and illegal hacking.
Ethical hacking involves authorized testing of computer systems and
networks to identify vulnerabilities and improve security. On the other
hand, illegal hacking entails unauthorized access to systems or data
with malicious intent, which is a criminal offense punishable by law.

When selecting a Facebook hacking course in Delhi, consider factors such
as the instructor's expertise, course curriculum, hands-on experience,
and reviews from past students. Look for courses that cover a wide range
of hacking techniques, including social engineering, phishing, and
exploiting vulnerabilities. Additionally, opt for courses that emphasize
ethical hacking principles and ethical responsibility.
