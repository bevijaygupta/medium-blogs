### Introduction {#8947 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--figure name="8947"}

As businesses increasingly adopt cloud computing to leverage its
scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness, security remains a
paramount concern. Ensuring robust cloud security is critical to protect
sensitive data, maintain compliance with regulations, and mitigate cyber
threats. In this blog, we will explore the essential questions
businesses should ask to ensure their cloud environments are secure.
Covering various aspects of cloud security, these questions provide a
comprehensive framework for evaluating and enhancing cloud security
measures.

### 1. What is the Shared Responsibility Model? {#fea6 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="fea6"}

Understanding the shared responsibility model is foundational to cloud
security. This model delineates the security responsibilities of both
cloud service providers (CSPs) and customers.

### Key Questions: {#4a56 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="4a56"}

- [What are the specific security responsibilities of the CSP?]{#a139}
- [What security measures are customers responsible for?]{#f0cd}
- [How does the CSP ensure the security of the cloud
  infrastructure?]{#2d47}

### Explanation: {#c560 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="c560"}

The shared responsibility model typically divides responsibilities into
two main categories:

- [**Security of the Cloud:** Managed by the CSP, this includes the
  physical infrastructure, hardware, software, networking, and
  facilities that run the cloud services.]{#41d6}
- [**Security in the Cloud:** Managed by the customer, this includes the
  data, applications, access management, and configurations within the
  cloud environment.]{#1b0f}

Understanding these roles helps avoid security gaps and ensures both
parties contribute to maintaining a secure cloud infrastructure.

### 2. How is Data Protected in the Cloud? {#c95c .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="c95c"}

Data protection is a critical component of cloud security, encompassing
data at rest, in transit, and during processing.

### Key Questions: {#ff59 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="ff59"}
