#### Introduction: The Hype Around Cybersecurity Careers {#ab70 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--figure name="ab70"}

Cybersecurity is often glamorized as a high-paying field that offers job
security, growth opportunities, and a chance to make a real-world
impact. The sector is booming, and news articles constantly remind us of
the need for cybersecurity professionals due to the increasing number of
cyber threats. But despite all the hype, as a public speaker and
presenter in the industry, I often caution aspiring professionals and
career-changers against rushing headlong into this career path without
understanding what they are signing up for.

In this blog, I want to share the often-overlooked downsides of a career
in cybersecurity. This is not to discourage those who are truly
passionate but to help them prepare and make an informed decision. Too
often, I encounter individuals who jump into cybersecurity purely for
financial reasons, only to end up disillusioned and stressed. This
industry requires more than just technical skills and a willingness to
earn a six-figure salary. Let's explore why.

#### 1. The Intense Stress Levels and Burnout Culture {#0b9f .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="0b9f"}

Let's start with one of the most significant issues in the industry:
**stress**. In cybersecurity, you're not merely working on preventing
hypothetical issues; you're actively fighting an ongoing, ever-evolving
war. The stakes are high because a breach can mean the loss of millions
of dollars, reputation damage, and potential lawsuits for your
organization. Professionals often have to work long hours, especially
when responding to incidents or dealing with large-scale breaches.

Many cybersecurity roles, such as incident responders, SOC (Security
Operations Center) analysts, and penetration testers, are known for
their unpredictable work schedules. The job requires constant vigilance
and often demands round-the-clock availability. There's no 9-to-5 when
your systems are under attack.

**Burnout** is prevalent in the field, with many professionals
struggling to maintain work-life balance. In fact, a recent study
conducted by Nominet found that over **91% of cybersecurity
professionals** experience moderate to high-stress levels, with many
contemplating a career change due to mental health concerns.

### 2. Rapidly Changing Technology and Knowledge Obsolescence {#2f14 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="2f14"}

In cybersecurity, **knowledge obsolescence** is a real problem. The
threat landscape and technologies evolve faster than most other
industries, which means you need to be in a state of constant learning.
What you know today could be irrelevant in six months. New tools,
techniques, and frameworks are emerging every year, making it necessary
for professionals to keep up with continuous education.

This necessity to constantly upgrade your skills can be both
**time-consuming and costly**. Professionals are expected to pursue
additional certifications, online courses, and self-study to stay
relevant. Even if you have an impressive array of certifications,
companies will still look at your practical knowledge and experience as
a determining factor. It's a race that never ends, and many people find
it overwhelming.

### 3. Cybersecurity Isn't Just Technical: Expect Bureaucracy and Politics {#de13 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="de13"}

Another often-ignored aspect is that cybersecurity isn't just about
hacking systems or protecting networks. **You are not just an engineer;
you are also a diplomat and negotiator**. You have to deal with various
stakeholders within an organization, such as managers, executives,
developers, and compliance officers. Getting everyone on board with your
security measures often involves navigating organizational politics and
convincing people to prioritize security over convenience.

Moreover, the implementation of security policies is heavily influenced
by **corporate bureaucracy**, where budgets, timelines, and differing
priorities create an environment that's resistant to change.
Cybersecurity professionals often face the challenge of balancing what
they know is necessary with what the company is willing to implement.
This dissonance can lead to frustration, especially when upper
management doesn't support your recommendations due to perceived cost or
complexity.

### 4. Unrealistic Job Expectations and Skill Gaps {#04bd .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="04bd"}

**Expectations vs. Reality** is a recurring theme in this field.
Entry-level cybersecurity professionals often find that the actual job
is not what they imagined. It's common for job descriptions to be filled
with requirements that seem unrealistic for a single role. Employers
often want a mix of a network engineer, penetration tester, and incident
responder all rolled into one person.

Additionally, the current **skills gap** in the industry is not just
about the shortage of professionals but also about employers having
unrealistic demands. They want candidates with five years of experience
in a tool that's only three years old or candidates who are proficient
in numerous programming languages, network protocols, and specialized
tools. This skill mismatch can be disheartening for new professionals or
even those trying to switch from other IT sectors.

### 5. High Stakes and No Room for Error {#1b16 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="1b16"}

Cybersecurity is an area where the **stakes are incredibly high**. One
small error can result in a major breach, which can have severe
financial and reputational consequences for a company. This creates a
lot of pressure for cybersecurity professionals to be perfect, even
though nobody can ever be 100% secure. The threats are continually
evolving, and attackers only need to find one vulnerability to succeed.
In contrast, defenders need to identify and close every possible
vulnerability.

This constant pressure to be error-free can create an **environment of
fear** and anxiety, leading to second-guessing and even more stress.
There's always the fear of what you might have missed or an unknown
vulnerability that could come back to haunt you.

### 6. Salary Isn't Everything: Misleading High-Pay Hype {#9abe .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="9abe"}

One of the biggest reasons people are drawn to cybersecurity is the
promise of **high salaries**. It's true that some roles in cybersecurity
do pay well, especially in high-demand areas like penetration testing,
incident response, or CISO (Chief Information Security Officer)
positions. But the **reality is that not everyone in the field is making
six figures**.

The entry-level salaries aren't always as high as the hype suggests, and
the increase in salary often correlates directly with the amount of
responsibility and stress you take on. Moreover, the promise of high pay
leads to intense competition, making it challenging for newcomers to
stand out without significant skills, experience, and certifications.

### 7. The Dark Side of Working in Cybersecurity {#2897 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="2897"}

There's an often overlooked **emotional toll** in cybersecurity roles.
You're constantly exposed to malicious actions, unethical activities,
and data breaches. You might find yourself reading through chat logs of
hackers planning their next attack or witnessing how attackers
manipulate people to achieve their malicious goals.

Being constantly exposed to this dark side can lead to **cynicism and
distrust** in people, systems, and processes. The need to always be
skeptical can bleed into your personal life, where you start to question
everything and everyone. This constant state of hyper-vigilance can
contribute to anxiety, social isolation, and even depression over time.

### 8. Cybersecurity Certifications Are Expensive and Never-Ending {#91ed .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="91ed"}

The world of cybersecurity is often driven by **certifications**. From
the **CompTIA Security+** to **CISSP**, certifications are a rite of
passage in the industry. While these certifications add value and help
you stand out, they come at a hefty price. Many of them are costly, and
their value often comes into question as more professionals enter the
industry with similar credentials.

However, what most people don't realize is that certifications have
**expiration dates**. You have to renew them every few years by
attending training sessions, paying renewal fees, and gathering
Continuing Professional Education (CPE) credits. It becomes a
never-ending cycle of proving your worth to employers and investing more
money in certifications to stay relevant.

### 9. The Myth of Job Security in Cybersecurity {#a45f .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="a45f"}

The industry portrays a false sense of **job security**, citing the
increasing number of cyber-attacks as evidence. While the demand for
cybersecurity roles is indeed on the rise, this doesn't mean that every
role comes with guaranteed stability. Economic downturns, organizational
restructuring, and automation advancements can all result in job losses,
even in cybersecurity.

Moreover, cybersecurity teams are often among the first to face budget
cuts, despite the increasing need for protection. Many companies still
see cybersecurity as a cost center rather than a business enabler. This
lack of understanding from upper management often results in
cybersecurity professionals facing layoffs or reductions in team sizes
when financial constraints arise.

### 10. Work-Life Balance Is a Myth in Cybersecurity {#0c2b .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="0c2b"}

The final nail in the coffin for many is the lack of **work-life
balance**. Many roles require you to be on call 24/7 or respond
immediately to breaches and incidents, regardless of the hour. If you
have a family or enjoy hobbies outside of work, this type of lifestyle
can lead to **strained relationships** and **burnout**.

It's not uncommon for professionals in cybersecurity to lose track of
personal time due to unexpected incidents. Even if you're not officially
on call, the nature of cybersecurity is such that **you are always
mentally alert** to what could go wrong. The inability to truly
disconnect can leave you feeling trapped in your job, eroding the
boundaries between work and life.

### Conclusion: Should You Get into Cybersecurity? {#4011 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="4011"}

It's easy to see why cybersecurity is often portrayed as an exciting,
well-paying career. There's a sense of heroism attached to fighting off
cyber threats and protecting companies and individuals from harm.
However, as I've outlined in this blog, there's a darker side to the
industry that aspiring professionals should be aware of before diving in
headfirst.

If you're genuinely passionate about technology and have a natural
curiosity to learn and understand how things work, then cybersecurity
can be a rewarding path. But it's not a field for those looking for a
**quick paycheck** or a **stress-free job**. The mental toll, high
stakes, and constantly evolving landscape require dedication,
resilience, and genuine interest in the work.

So, should you get into cybersecurity? The answer is a resounding
**maybe**. Be sure to weigh the pros and cons carefully. Don't be swayed
by the glamour or the paycheck. Instead, understand the reality of the
industry and ask yourself if you're ready to commit to a demanding
career that requires continuous learning, resilience, and an ability to
handle immense pressure.

Cybersecurity isn't for everyone, and that's okay. There are many other
fulfilling and exciting career paths in technology that might align
better with your personality, skills, and aspirations. Just remember,
**it's better to be in a career that makes you happy and fulfilled,
rather than in one that leaves you burned out and dissatisfied**.
