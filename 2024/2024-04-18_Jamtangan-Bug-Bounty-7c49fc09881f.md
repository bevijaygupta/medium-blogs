In the vast world of cybersecurity, bug bounty programs have emerged as
a pivotal tool for organizations to bolster their defense mechanisms.
One such intriguing initiative is the Jamtangan Bug Bounty program.
While "Jamtangan" translates to "wristwatch" in Malay, the term here
takes on a metaphorical meaning, suggesting a vigilant watch over

discovering and responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities in an
organization's software, applications, or systems. These programs play a
crucial role in identifying and addressing security flaws before they
can be exploited maliciously.

By incentivizing ethical hacking, bug bounty programs harness the
collective intelligence of the global cybersecurity community to enhance
an organization's security posture. Rewards can range from monetary
bounties to recognition and sometimes even exclusive merchandise or
invitations to private events.
