    prevention system (IDS/IPS) that helps organizations detect and
    prevent malicious activity within their network environment. By
    analyzing network traffic in real-time and matching it against
    predefined rulesets, Snort can identify and block suspicious
    behavior, such as malware infections and intrusion attempts.]{#b1a7}
4.  [**ELK Stack:** The ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) Stack is a
    powerful platform for log management and analysis. By ingesting log
    data from various sources, normalizing it, and visualizing it
    through Kibana dashboards, organizations can gain actionable
    insights into their network security posture and detect security
    incidents.]{#2a94}
5.  [**Metasploit:** Metasploit is a penetration testing framework that
    helps security professionals simulate real-world cyber attacks and
    identify vulnerabilities within network systems. With its extensive
    library of exploits and payloads, Metasploit enables organizations
