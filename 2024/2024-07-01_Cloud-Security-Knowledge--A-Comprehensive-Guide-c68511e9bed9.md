### Introduction to Cloud Security {#d4ba .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="d4ba"}

Cloud security encompasses a wide range of strategies and practices
aimed at protecting data, applications, and infrastructures associated
with cloud computing. It involves safeguarding against data breaches,
data loss, and other forms of cyber threats. Effective cloud security is
essential for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of cloud resources. Given the shared responsibility model
in cloud computing, both cloud service providers (CSPs) and customers
play critical roles in ensuring security.

### Understanding the Shared Responsibility Model {#27c2 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="27c2"}

The shared responsibility model delineates the security responsibilities
of CSPs and their customers. While the specifics may vary across
providers, the general principles remain consistent:

- [**Cloud Service Providers**: Responsible for securing the cloud
  infrastructure, including physical data centers, servers, and network
  hardware. CSPs also manage and secure the virtualization layer and
  provide tools for customers to use in securing their data and
  applications.]{#b75a}
- [**Customers**: Responsible for securing their data, applications,
  operating systems, and configurations. This includes managing user
  access, encrypting data, and ensuring compliance with security
  policies.]{#46ca}

### Key Components of Cloud Security {#5d48 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="5d48"}

Encryption is the process of converting data into a format that is
unreadable to unauthorized users. It is a fundamental aspect of cloud
security.

- [**Encryption in Transit**: Protects data as it moves between the user
  and the cloud or between different cloud services. Protocols like
  Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) are
  commonly used.]{#2e4d}
- [**Encryption at Rest**: Ensures that data stored on cloud servers is
  secure. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a widely used encryption
  algorithm for this purpose.]{#25c6}
- [**End-to-End Encryption**: Encrypts data on the sender's device and
  decrypts it only on the recipient's device, ensuring complete
  protection during transit.]{#0334}

#### Data Masking and Tokenization {#7d36 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--li name="7d36"}

- [**Data Masking**: Involves obscuring specific data within a database
  to protect it from unauthorized access. This technique is often used
  in testing environments to protect sensitive information.]{#d8b8}
- [**Tokenization**: Replaces sensitive data with unique identification
  symbols (tokens) that retain all the essential information about the
  data without compromising its security.]{#a942}
