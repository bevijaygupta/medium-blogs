### 1. Automated Device Enrollment: Start Up and Go {#fbe1 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="fbe1"}

Automated device enrollment is one of the standout features of Microsoft
Intune, drastically reducing the time needed for new device setup.
Through Windows Autopilot, a device can be configured the moment it's
powered on, connecting to the company's network with predetermined
policies, apps, and settings. This benefit removes manual steps from IT
teams, enabling faster deployment without compromising accuracy.

### Why It's Important: {#6d48 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="6d48"}

With automated enrollment, employees can receive devices that are ready
to use out of the box. This feature is essential in remote or hybrid
work environments, where employees may not be physically present to
receive manual setup assistance.

### 2. Third-Party Security Integration: Comprehensive Security Without the Hassle {#38c9 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="38c9"}

Integrating security tools can be challenging, but Intune makes it easy
to use existing third-party security solutions. This capability enables
businesses to strengthen device security without sacrificing
compatibility or incurring the costs of switching to new systems.

### Why It's Important: {#35c7 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="35c7"}

Intune's integration with third-party security tools allows businesses
to create a cohesive security environment tailored to their needs. It's
particularly useful for large organizations that have invested heavily
in security infrastructure and want to retain those investments while
enhancing them with Intune's management capabilities.

### 3. Custom Compliance Policies: Maintain Full Control with Personalized Security {#be60 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="be60"}

Maintaining control over device compliance is crucial, especially in
industries with strict regulatory requirements. Intune's custom
compliance policies give organizations the flexibility to set specific
rules for device health, encryption, and more.

### Why It's Important: {#6fd4 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="6fd4"}

Custom compliance policies provide a proactive approach to device
management. By defining personalized compliance rules, companies can
ensure that only compliant devices access sensitive resources,
protecting data and minimizing potential threats.

### 4. Remote Assistance: Support From Anywhere, Anytime {#3ee2 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="3ee2"}

The modern workforce is more dispersed than ever, which can complicate
IT support efforts. Intune's remote assistance feature lets IT teams
provide instant support to devices regardless of their location.

### Why It's Important: {#8b89 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="8b89"}

With remote assistance, IT staff can diagnose and resolve issues without
needing physical access to the device. This feature is invaluable for
remote or hybrid organizations, as it eliminates downtime and ensures
that employees receive timely support, no matter where they are.

### 5. App Configuration Policies: Save Time with Pre-Configured Apps {#8768 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="8768"}

Intune allows administrators to pre-configure applications based on
company policies, reducing the amount of setup required on the user's
end. This includes setting permissions, configuring app behavior, and
automatically installing necessary applications.

### Why It's Important: {#d35d .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="d35d"}

Pre-configured apps ensure that users have all necessary tools upon
device enrollment, enabling a seamless work experience from day one.
This feature can significantly boost productivity, as employees no
longer need to navigate complex setup procedures or request app
installations from IT.

### 6. Conditional Access: Secure Cloud Access on Demand {#002d .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="002d"}

Conditional access is one of Intune's powerful security features,
allowing administrators to control access to company resources based on
predefined conditions. Only devices that meet certain compliance
standards can access cloud applications.

### Why It's Important: {#588f .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="588f"}

Conditional access allows organizations to minimize security risks
without hindering accessibility. This is essential for teams that rely
on cloud-based apps and need to secure data while allowing remote
access. By enabling this feature, companies can enforce strict security
standards and reduce potential exposure to vulnerabilities.

### 7. Automated Remediation: Problems Solved Without Intervention {#3ae5 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="3ae5"}

Automated remediation lets Intune detect and fix certain issues without
manual intervention. For example, if a device falls out of compliance,
Intune can trigger specific actions to address the problem, such as
pushing software updates or reconfiguring settings.

### Why It's Important: {#7e41 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="7e41"}

Automated remediation reduces IT overhead by eliminating the need for
constant monitoring and manual fixes. This feature enhances security and
compliance, ensuring that devices remain in good health with minimal
disruption to users or the IT team.

### 8. Endpoint Analytics: See Problems Before They Happen {#c245 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="c245"}

Microsoft Intune's endpoint analytics offer insights into the health and
performance of devices across the organization. By monitoring key
metrics, administrators can identify potential issues before they
escalate, reducing downtime and preventing potential disruptions.

### Why It's Important: {#3249 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="3249"}

Proactive device management is essential for maximizing productivity.
Endpoint analytics enable IT teams to make data-driven decisions,
reducing the likelihood of device malfunctions that could disrupt
business operations. This feature is particularly useful in large
organizations where minor issues can quickly multiply.

### 9. Windows Autopilot: Deploy Ready-to-Use Devices {#72f9 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="72f9"}

Windows Autopilot is a powerful Intune tool that helps organizations
streamline new device deployments. Devices enrolled in Autopilot are
automatically configured to organization standards, eliminating manual
setup steps and reducing device downtime.

### Why It's Important: {#dd8d .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="dd8d"}

For companies that manage large fleets of devices, Autopilot is a
lifesaver. It simplifies the deployment process, ensuring that devices
arrive configured and ready to work. The consistent setup experience it
offers is crucial for maintaining uniformity across devices, which is
vital for both productivity and security.

### 10. Application-Level VPN: Secure Only What Needs to Be Secured {#0047 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="0047"}

Microsoft Intune supports application-level VPNs, which allow
administrators to secure specific apps rather than the entire device.
This feature is particularly beneficial in bring-your-own-device (BYOD)
environments, where personal devices access company data.

### Why It's Important: {#9a3f .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="9a3f"}

Application-level VPNs balance security with user privacy by ensuring
that only sensitive applications are routed through secure channels. For
employees using personal devices, this approach is less intrusive, while
still protecting corporate data from unauthorized access.

tracking inventory, managing updates, and deploying applications,
creating a robust, all-in-one solution for device management. With its
seamless integration into the Microsoft ecosystem, Intune allows
businesses to leverage other tools like Azure Active Directory (AAD) and
Microsoft Defender, making it a powerful choice for organizations
looking to optimize their IT operations.
