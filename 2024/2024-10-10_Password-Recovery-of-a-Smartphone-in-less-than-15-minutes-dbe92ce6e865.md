In today's era, safeguarding personal data with passwords is the norm.
However, this routine security measure presents a unique challenge for
investigators seeking access to devices while adhering to legal and
ethical guidelines. In a recent assignment, a prestigious Government
Organization sought assistance in unlocking a Vivo Y21G phone
safeguarded by a 4-digit passcode. Join us as we unveil the intricate
process of unlocking the device while maintaining the utmost integrity
throughout this digital quest.

The Vivo Y21G phone was protected by a passcode, making conventional
unlocking methods ineffective. The first step in tackling this challenge
was to conduct a comprehensive examination of the device to understand
its specifications and potential vulnerabilities. Initial attempts to
boot the device from recovery mode using button combinations proved
futile, highlighting the need for a more sophisticated approach.

To surmount this, we employed the JTAG (Joint Test Action Group)
technique, a method used for acquiring data from devices that cannot be
accessed through conventional means. JTAG entails establishing a
connection to the device's Standard Test Access Ports (TAPs) and
instructing the processor to transfer raw data from the connected memory
chips (IC).

Mastering the JTAG technique requires a high level of skill and
expertise. The procedure involved a meticulous identification and
precise connection to specific test points on the device using pin
probes. Once the device was successfully connected and in recovery mode,
the Passware Kit Mobile PKM Tool was used which created a comprehensive
backup of the device before applying Brute Force attack, that uses
advanced algorithms and considerable computational power to
systematically test all possible passcode combinations and unlock the
phone. Astonishingly, the passcode (4 digit here) was successfully
cracked in less than 15 minutes, showcasing the efficacy of this
approach.

With the passcode successfully bypassed, the acquired data was
meticulously processed and analyzed in line with the customer's
requirements. This step was crucial in extracting relevant information
while maintaining data integrity throughout the investigation.

Following the successful extraction and analysis of the device's data,
the Vivo Y21G phone was reassembled to its original state and handed
over to the client. This comprehensive investigation delivered the
client precisely what they sought: relevant and vital information, all
achieved within the framework of the highest integrity and legality in
digital forensics.

The journey through digital forensics is challenging and intricate, but
the mastery of techniques ensures that we make strides in fortifying our
nation's digital landscape. Stay connected as we conquer these
challenges on our journey toward a digitally sound nation safeguarding
our collective digital future.
