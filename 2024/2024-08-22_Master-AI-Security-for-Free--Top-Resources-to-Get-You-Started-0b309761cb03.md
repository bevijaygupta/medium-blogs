**1. Understanding the Basics of AI Security**

Before diving into the resources, it's essential to understand what AI
security entails. AI security focuses on protecting AI systems from
threats that can compromise their integrity, confidentiality, and
availability. This includes safeguarding AI algorithms, data used for
training and inference, and the infrastructure supporting AI
applications.

Key areas of AI security include:

- [**Adversarial Attacks:** Techniques where attackers manipulate input
  data to deceive AI models into making incorrect predictions or
  classifications.]{#c595}
- [**Data Poisoning:** Injecting malicious data into training datasets
  to corrupt the model's learning process.]{#490c}
- [**Model Inversion Attacks:** Attempting to reverse-engineer a model
  to extract sensitive information from it.]{#8fbd}
- [**Model Stealing:** Duplicating a proprietary model by querying it
  and using the output to create a replica.]{#f145}
- [**Privacy Concerns:** Ensuring that AI systems respect user privacy,
  especially when handling sensitive data.]{#c925}

Understanding these areas will provide you with a solid foundation as
you begin exploring the resources available to learn AI security.
