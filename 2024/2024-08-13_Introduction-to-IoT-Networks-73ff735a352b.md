IoT networks consist of several key components that work together to
ensure the smooth operation of connected devices. These components
include:

**Sensors and Actuators**:

- [**Sensors** are devices that collect data from the environment, such
  as temperature, humidity, light, motion, and more. They convert
  physical phenomena into electrical signals that can be processed by
  the network.]{#4110}
- [**Actuators** are devices that perform actions based on the data
  received from sensors. For example, a thermostat (actuator) may adjust
  the temperature in a room based on readings from a temperature
  sensor.]{#0041}

**Gateways**:

Gateways act as intermediaries between sensors, actuators, and the
cloud. They aggregate data from various sensors, preprocess it, and
transmit it to cloud platforms for further analysis. Gateways also
facilitate communication between devices using different protocols and
ensure security through encryption and authentication.

real-time insights and decision-making. Cloud platforms also host
applications that control IoT devices and manage their operations.

**Communication Protocols**:

Communication protocols define how data is transmitted between devices
in an IoT network. Common IoT protocols include MQTT (Message Queuing
Telemetry Transport), CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol), and
HTTP/HTTPS. The choice of protocol depends on factors such as data
volume, latency requirements, and power consumption.

**Edge Computing**:

Edge computing refers to processing data closer to the source (i.e., at
the edge of the network) rather than relying solely on cloud-based
processing. This approach reduces latency, minimizes bandwidth usage,
and enhances data security. Edge devices, such as edge gateways and
routers, play a crucial role in enabling edge computing within IoT
networks.

### Types of IoT Networks {#e560 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="e560"}

IoT networks can be classified into different types based on their
range, architecture, and communication protocols. Some of the most
common types include:

**Local Area Networks (LANs)**:

LANs connect devices within a limited geographical area, such as a home,
office, or factory. These networks are typically used for home
automation, smart buildings, and industrial IoT applications. Wi-Fi,
Zigbee, and Bluetooth are popular communication technologies used in
LAN-based IoT networks.

**Wide Area Networks (WANs)**:

WANs cover larger geographical areas, often connecting devices across
cities, regions, or even countries. These networks are essential for
applications such as smart cities, agriculture, and logistics. Cellular
networks (3G, 4G, 5G), LPWAN (Low Power Wide Area Network) technologies
like LoRaWAN and Sigfox, and satellite communication are common WAN
technologies.

**Personal Area Networks (PANs)**:

PANs connect devices within a close range, typically within a few
meters. These networks are used for wearable devices, fitness trackers,
and other personal gadgets. Bluetooth and Zigbee are common
communication protocols for PAN-based IoT networks.

**Mesh Networks**:

Mesh networks are decentralized networks where each device (node)
communicates with its neighboring nodes, forming a mesh-like structure.
This type of network is highly resilient and can self-heal in case of
node failures. Mesh networks are ideal for applications that require
extensive coverage, such as smart lighting, environmental monitoring,
and disaster management.
