### Task 1: Intro {#b46d .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="b46d"}

Cryptography is a big topic. We are going to cover the basics, to give
you a basic understanding.

It is used by a wide range of applications, almost everywhere in the
internet.

Why we need cryptography?

Without encryption communications over the internet will be very
insecure, and it would be very easy for someone to see your data.
Fortunately this isn't true, and almost all of the data you get/send
over the internet is encrypted and cannot be seen in plain text by
someone who got access to it. Now let's look into cryptography in more
detail.

### Task 2: Types of cryptography {#99a4 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="99a4"}

There are two types of cryptography :

- [Symmetric]{#a329}
- [Asymmetric]{#8fc5}

What is symmetric cryptography?

Let's say Alice wants to send message to Bob, but she doesn't want to
send the message in plain text because anyone can read it.

She has a recipe how to mess up the letters in a way that no one can
understand what it means(that is called **encryption**). Bob has the
same recipe but he uses it to order them so it will become readable
again(that is called **decryption**), and he will understand what Alice
wrote. The recipe in cryptography is called a **key**. In symmetric
cryptography both users have the same key to encrypt and decrypt the
messages.

What is asymmetric cryptography?

In asymmetric cryptography the encryption and decryption keys are
different. The encryption key can be used only for encryption, not for
decryption and vice versa. The encryption key is called **Public key**
and the decryption key is called **Private key**.

Why is asymmetric cryptography used?

Well..because it's more secure! If you are using symmetric cryptography
and someone takes your key he can encrypt and decrypt messages that you
send. While in asymmetric cryptography he can't decrypt the messages you
encrypted with the public key. Only the holder of the Private key can
decrypt them. Let's give an example :

Alice wants to talk to Google

Google gives Alice the Public key.

Alice encrypts her message with the public key and sends it to Google.

Google decrypts the message with his private key and sends back what
Alice wanted.

And that's how the conversation goes...

Note : Symmetric cryptography is faster than asymmetric, but asymmetric
is more secure.

Now let's see what you've learned!

**Q.1**: What type of cryptography is more secure?

> ***Answer: Asymmetric***

**Q.2:** What type of cryptography is faster?

> ***Answer: Asymmetric***

**Q.3:** What type of cryptography will a Bank site use?

> ***Answer: Asymmetric***

**Q.4:** What will you use to encrypt your messages in asymmetric
cryptography?

> ***Answer: public key***

**Q.5:** What will you use to decrypt messages in asymmetric
cryptography?

> ***Answer: private key***

**Q.6:** Does symmetric cryptography use two different keys for
encryption/decryption? (aye/nay)

> ***Answer: Nay***

### Task 3: What is a hash? {#8e4a .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--blockquote name="8e4a"}

Hashes are a long strings of letters and numbers generated by hashing
algorithms. They take plain text and make it a hash.

The important thing about hashes is that **they are not reversible**.
There's no way to decrypt/decode a hash.

data-width="611" data-height="223" />
</figure>

Popular hashing algorithms are : MD5 (Message Digest 5) and SHA (Secure
Hash Algorithm).

That's how the word "hello" looks as MD5 hash :
**5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592**

**What are hashes used for?**

The most popular use of hashes is for file identification and storing
sensitive data, like passwords. When you create an account on a website
your password is converted to hash and this hash is stored in the
server's database. So when you login the password that you type in will
be converted to a hash, the server will take it and compare it with the
hash in it's database, if it's the same that means your password is
correct and the server will let you in.

MD5 hashes are also used to ensure the data integrity of files. Because
the MD5 hashing algorithm always produces the same output for the same
given input, it can be used to compare a hash of the source file with a
newly created hash of the destination file to check that it is intact
and unmodified.

There are plenty of other hashing algorithms out there, but this room is
intended for beginners so we're not going to cover them here.

**Q.1:** What's the MD5 hash of "hashes are cool"?

**Q.2:** What does MD5 stand for?

> ***Answer: Message Digest 5***

**Q.3:** Who created MD5?

> ***Answer: Ronald Rivest***

### Task 4: Decoding/encoding {#a77a .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--blockquote name="a77a"}

There's difference between encoding and encrypting. Let's say you have
an encrypted file, the only way to decrypt it is using key. While
encoded data can be decoded immediately, without keys. It's **NOT** a
form of encryption, it just a way of representing data.

A very popular encoding is Base64. Here's how "hi there" looks with
Base64 encoding : **aGkgdGhlcmU=**

**Q.1:** Encode the string "cryptographyisuseful" with Base64

data-width="456" data-height="87" />

**Q.2:** Decode the string
"dGhlIHNlY3JldCB3b3JkIGlzIDogd2F0ZXJtZWxvbg==". What's the secret word?
