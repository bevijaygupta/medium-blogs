If you're aspiring to land a job as a security analyst, chances are
you've considered diving into hacking courses or ethical hacking
certifications. While hacking is undoubtedly a valuable skill in the
cybersecurity domain, focusing on it too early can sidetrack you from
developing the foundational knowledge and skills that are critical for
success as a security analyst. In this blog, we'll outline 13 better
skills you should focus on first to build a strong career in
cybersecurity.

### 1. Understanding Networking Fundamentals {#7c34 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="7c34"}

Networking is the backbone of cybersecurity. Without a solid grasp of
how networks function, you'll struggle to identify vulnerabilities or
respond to security incidents effectively.

- [Learn about protocols such as TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP, and HTTP.]{#6893}

- [Tools to explore: Wireshark, Cisco Packet Tracer.]{#2203}

### 2. Mastering Operating System Basics {#00ef .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="00ef"}

Security analysts must be comfortable with both Windows and Linux
operating systems, as most cyber incidents occur on these platforms.

- [Learn Windows Event Logs and Linux log management.]{#c44c}
- [Understand user management, permissions, and file systems.]{#c53c}
- [Familiarize yourself with command-line tools like PowerShell and
  Bash.]{#b31b}

### 3. Developing Incident Response Skills {#35d9 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="35d9"}

Incident response is a core responsibility of a security analyst.
Knowing how to act quickly during a breach can make or break your
career.

- [Study incident response frameworks like NIST or MITRE ATT&CK.]{#62d0}
- [Learn about detection, containment, eradication, and recovery
  processes.]{#03fa}
- [Practice with SIEM tools like Splunk or QRadar.]{#2d61}

### 4. Learning Security Monitoring and Analysis {#dfc5 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="dfc5"}

Security analysts must monitor and analyze security data to detect
anomalies.

- [Understand log management and analysis.]{#72b8}
- [Learn how to configure and use intrusion detection/prevention systems
  (IDS/IPS).]{#5cc0}
- [Explore tools like Graylog, LogRhythm, and ELK Stack.]{#8145}

Risk management helps organizations prioritize their security efforts.

- [Learn how to identify, assess, and mitigate risks.]{#e9bc}
- [Study compliance standards like GDPR, ISO 27001, and NIST
  Cybersecurity Framework.]{#a907}
- [Practice creating risk assessments and security policies.]{#254f}

### 6. Exploring Threat Intelligence {#890c .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="890c"}

Threat intelligence involves understanding the tactics and motives of
attackers.

- [Familiarize yourself with open-source intelligence (OSINT).]{#ebf3}
- [Study common attack vectors like phishing, malware, and social
  engineering.]{#ca05}
- [Tools to explore: VirusTotal, ThreatConnect, and Maltego.]{#674c}

### 7. Learning Vulnerability Management {#0c39 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="0c39"}

Security analysts must identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in systems
and applications.

- [Learn how to conduct vulnerability scans.]{#7712}
- [Understand patch management and configuration management.]{#dee5}
- [Tools to explore: Nessus, OpenVAS, and Qualys.]{#51dd}

### 8. Mastering Cybersecurity Frameworks {#9244 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="9244"}

Security frameworks provide structured approaches to securing IT
environments.

- [Learn about frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK, CIS Controls, and the Cyber
  Kill Chain.]{#236b}
- [Study how these frameworks can be applied in real-world
  scenarios.]{#6865}

### 9. Developing Soft Skills {#c82f .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="c82f"}

Communication and collaboration are just as important as technical
expertise.

- [Learn how to write detailed incident reports.]{#d2b7}
- [Practice explaining technical concepts to non-technical
  stakeholders.]{#47b1}
- [Develop teamwork and project management skills.]{#738e}

### 10. Understanding Encryption and Cryptography {#b439 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="b439"}

Encryption is the cornerstone of secure communication and data
protection.

- [Learn the basics of symmetric and asymmetric encryption.]{#dcd3}
- [Study common algorithms like AES, RSA, and SHA.]{#eb71}
- [Explore how encryption is used in SSL/TLS, VPNs, and file
  security.]{#1ac4}

### 11. Familiarizing Yourself with Endpoint Security {#568e .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="568e"}

Endpoint devices are prime targets for attackers.

- [Understand endpoint protection tools like antivirus software and EDR
  (Endpoint Detection and Response).]{#b7a3}
- [Learn how to analyze malware behavior.]{#78df}

### 12. Acquiring Cloud Security Knowledge {#66b1 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="66b1"}

Hands-on experience is invaluable for security analysts.

- [Participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges.]{#2fd9}
- [Set up a home lab to practice incident response and
  monitoring.]{#be9c}
- [Explore platforms like TryHackMe, Hack The Box, and
  RangeForce.]{#4b75}

### Why Not Focus Solely on Hacking? {#7564 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="7564"}

Hacking skills like penetration testing and vulnerability exploitation
are crucial for offensive security roles like ethical hacking or red
teaming. However, a security analyst's role is largely defensive,
focusing on monitoring, detecting, and responding to security threats.
Learning hacking before mastering the basics can leave significant gaps
in your skill set, making it harder to perform effectively as a security
analyst.

### Final Thoughts {#6db1 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="6db1"}

Building a career as a security analyst requires a well-rounded
approach. By focusing on these 13 skills first, you'll be better
prepared to secure an organization's IT environment and respond to cyber
threats. Once you've mastered these areas, you can then consider diving
deeper into ethical hacking and penetration testing to broaden your
expertise.

Start today, and remember: cybersecurity is a marathon, not a sprint!
