### 1. What is Ethical Hacking? {#9009 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="9009"}

Ethical hacking involves authorized attempts to gain unauthorized access
to a system, application, or data. Ethical hackers, also known as "white
hats," perform penetration tests and vulnerability assessments to
identify weaknesses that malicious hackers could exploit. These
professionals use the same tools and methodologies as malicious hackers,
but with the permission of the system owner, ensuring their work is both
legal and beneficial.

### 2. What is ARP Poisoning? {#964e .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="964e"}

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning is an attack technique in
which an attacker sends falsified ARP messages over a local area
network. By doing this, the attacker associates their MAC address with
the IP address of another legitimate computer, enabling them to
intercept, modify, or stop data meant for that IP address. ARP poisoning
is often used for man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and is a serious
threat in unsecured networks.

### 3. What is SQL Injection? {#1790 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="1790"}

SQL Injection (SQLi) is a code injection technique that exploits
vulnerabilities in a website's database. By inserting malicious SQL
statements into input fields (such as login forms or search bars),
attackers can manipulate the backend SQL database. SQL injection can be
used to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as passwords
and usernames, and sometimes even take full control of the server.

### 4. What are the Types of Hackers? {#6366 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="6366"}

Hackers can be categorized into three main types based on their intent:

- [**White Hat Hackers**: Ethical hackers who help organizations secure
  their systems.]{#1d9b}
- [**Black Hat Hackers**: Malicious hackers who exploit vulnerabilities
  for personal gain or disruption.]{#47dd}
- [**Grey Hat Hackers**: A blend of both white and black hats, grey hats
  may exploit vulnerabilities but without malicious intent, often
  reporting them afterward.]{#adf4}

### 5. What is Footprinting? {#9a95 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="9a95"}

Footprinting is the first step in the hacking process. It involves
gathering information about a target system or network, such as IP
addresses, domain names, email addresses, and other publicly available
information. This step is crucial for planning the next stages of an
attack or penetration test.

### 6. What is Social Engineering? {#2667 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="2667"}

Social engineering is a psychological manipulation technique used to
trick individuals into divulging confidential information. It exploits
human behavior, trust, and ignorance, making it one of the most
effective ways to gain unauthorized access. Common social engineering
tactics include phishing, pretexting, baiting, and tailgating.

### 7. Differentiate Between IP and MAC Addresses {#180f .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="180f"}

- [**IP Address**: A unique identifier assigned to each device on a
  network, defining the device's location on the network.]{#c785}
- [**MAC Address**: A unique identifier assigned to the network
  interface card (NIC) of a device, serving as a hardware address for
  data transmission within a local network.]{#cca7}

### 8. What is a Firewall? {#f2cd .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="f2cd"}

A firewall is a network security device or software that monitors and
controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined
security rules. It acts as a barrier between trusted internal networks
and untrusted external networks, filtering traffic to prevent
unauthorized access.

testers and security analysts. It allows users to conduct security
testing of web applications by intercepting and manipulating traffic
between the client and server. Burp Suite provides features for
scanning, spidering, brute-forcing, and more.

### 10. What is a Penetration Testing Methodology? {#0db9 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="0db9"}

A penetration testing methodology is a structured approach to testing
the security of a system. It involves multiple phases such as planning,
information gathering, vulnerability analysis, exploitation, and
reporting. Popular methodologies include OWASP's testing guide, the PTES
(Penetration Testing Execution Standard), and NIST guidelines.

### 11. What is Cowpatty? {#73b8 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="73b8"}

Cowpatty is a tool used for brute-force attacks against WPA-PSK (Wi-Fi
Protected Access Pre-Shared Key). It helps crack the WPA key by trying
different passphrases until the correct one is found. Cowpatty is
commonly used with dictionary attacks on wireless networks.

### 12. What is Defacement? {#67a8 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="67a8"}

Defacement is an attack technique where a hacker changes the appearance
of a website or webpage by modifying its HTML, scripts, or server-side
files. Defacements are usually done to deliver a message, display
offensive content, or demonstrate the hacker's capabilities.

### 13. What is MAC Flooding? {#948b .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="948b"}

MAC flooding is an attack on a network switch where an attacker floods
the switch's MAC table with fake MAC addresses. When the table is full,
the switch enters a fail-open mode and behaves like a hub, sending data
to all ports. This exposes the network to eavesdropping and unauthorized
access.

### 14. What are the Best Sniffing Tools? {#ae3b .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="ae3b"}

Network sniffing tools capture and analyze network packets. Some of the
best sniffing tools include:
