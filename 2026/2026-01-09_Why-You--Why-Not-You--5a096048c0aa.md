A Question Every Founder, Hacker, and Employee Asks in Silence\*\*

"Why you?"

It's a question that doesn't always come from others.\
Most of the time, it comes from inside.

Why you should build that startup.\
Why you should apply for that role.\
Why you should speak up in meetings.\
Why you should believe you deserve more.

And often, the follow-up question is harsher:

"Why not someone better than me?"

### The Quiet Doubt Nobody Talks About {#a12f .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="a12f"}

Let's be honest.

[Startup founder](https://vijaykumargupta.in/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://vijaykumargupta.in/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank"}s rarely say it out loud, but many of them secretly
wonder:

*"Why would anyone invest in my idea?"*\
*"There are smarter founders, richer founders, more confident
founders."*

Corporate employees feel it too:

*"Why would my manager notice me?"*\
*"Why would they promote me when there are so many people like me?"*

Ethical hackers experience it differently:

*"Why would a company trust my report?"*\
*"Why would they believe my skills are real?"*

Gen Z feels it the earliest:

*"Everyone seems ahead."*\
*"Everyone seems to have it figured out."*

And so the question keeps repeating:

**Why me?**

### Here's the Truth No One Prepares You For {#8dda .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="8dda"}

Most opportunities don't start with certainty.

They start with **connection**.

You didn't talk to everyone.\
You didn't share your ideas with everyone.\
You didn't stay up late debugging, planning, or overthinking with
everyone.

You chose *this* path.\
You chose *this* problem.\
You chose *this* version of yourself to show up.

Not because you were extraordinary.

But because it felt right.

### Why You Didn't Need to Be "Special" to Begin {#e204 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="e204"}

There's a dangerous myth floating around:

That only extraordinary people succeed.

That founders are born confident.\
That hackers are naturally brilliant.\
That corporate leaders never doubt themselves.

That's false.

Most people who built something meaningful started with **nothing
figured out**.

They weren't remarkable.\
They weren't polished.\
They weren't ready.

They were just **willing**.

Willing to try.\
Willing to fail quietly.\
Willing to stay longer than others left.

### The Ethical Hacker Mindset: Trust Is Earned, Not Assumed {#201d .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="201d"}

In
[cybersecurity](https://einitial24.com/category/cybersecurity/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://einitial24.com/category/cybersecurity/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, trust is fragile.

One vulnerability disclosure can define your reputation.\
One mistake can burn bridges.

And when someone rejects your report or ignores your effort, the thought
hits hard:

*"Why did I even try?"*

But [ethical
hackers](https://einitial24.com/ethical-hacking-course/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://einitial24.com/ethical-hacking-course/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} understand something deeply:

You cannot force trust.\
You cannot force validation.\
You cannot force acceptance.

You show up.\
You do the work.\
You report responsibly.

And the right people stay.

The rest don't.

### Startup Founders: You Can't Force Belief {#12a3 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="12a3"}

Founders often fall into a trap:

Trying to convince everyone.

Investors.\
Users.\
Friends.\
Family.

But belief doesn't work like that.

If someone truly sees value in your vision, they stay.\
If they don't, no pitch deck can save it.

You cannot force someone to believe in you.\
And you shouldn't try.

Because the ones who matter don't need convincing.

### Corporate Employees: Loyalty Is a Choice, Not a Contract {#cffd .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="cffd"}

Many employees give their all expecting permanence.

Late nights.\
Extra effort.\
Silent sacrifices.

And when things don't work out, the questions return:

*"Why wasn't I enough?"*\
*"Why was I replaceable?"*

The harsh truth?

Workplaces are systems, not relationships.

People leave.\
Priorities change.\
Decisions are rarely personal.

You did your part.\
That is enough.

### Gen Z and the Fear of Being Left Behind {#f3cf .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="f3cf"}

Gen Z lives in comparison.

LinkedIn success stories.\
Twitter wins.\
Instagram highlights.

It feels like everyone else is winning faster.

But what you don't see:

The burnout.\
The impostor syndrome.\
The nights of doubt.

You're not behind.\
You're just early in your own journey.

### "You Always Meet the Wrong Opportunity" {#782d .graf .graf--h3 .graf--startsWithDoubleQuote .graf-after--p name="782d"}

Someone once said:

"Seems like you always meet the wrong people."

But maybe it's not wrong people.

Maybe it's **wrong timing**.\
Wrong alignment.\
Wrong expectations.

Every experience teaches you something:

What you won't tolerate.\
What you value.\
What you deserve.

### Why You Can't Force Anyone to Stay {#525f .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="525f"}

This applies everywhere:

- [Relationships]{#c913}
- [Startups]{#28d0}
- [Jobs]{#f279}
- [Partnerships]{#34fa}

You can't force anyone to stay aligned with you.

And you shouldn't want to.

Because the ones who stay **by choice** are the only ones worth building
with.

### Why You? Why Not You? {#2b39 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="2b39"}

So let's answer the question properly.

Why you should build that startup?\
Why you should switch careers?\
Why you should learn cybersecurity?\
Why you should ask for more?

Because someone has to.

And there is no rule that says it can't be you.

You don't need to be perfect.\
You don't need to have it all figured out.\
You just need to be honest with yourself.

### The Real Reason People Choose You {#2d43 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="2d43"}

People don't choose perfection.

They choose:

- [Someone who understands them]{#55f7}
- [Someone who listens]{#6338}
- [Someone who stays authentic]{#c646}
- [Someone who shows up consistently]{#c001}

That's it.

### One Day, You'll Understand This {#2e5c .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="2e5c"}

One day, you'll stop asking "Why me?"\
And start saying, "Why not me?"

Not out of arrogance.\
But out of self-respect.

Because sometimes, the person you're doubting...

Is exactly the person the opportunity was waiting for.

### Final Thought {#6ca6 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="6ca6"}

You don't need to convince the world.

You just need to stay long enough for the right people, ideas, and
opportunities to recognize you.

And when they do ---

They won't ask, "Why you?"

They'll already know.
