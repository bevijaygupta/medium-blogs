This question doesn't usually come with drama.\
It arrives quietly.

Sometimes at 2:37 AM.\
Sometimes while scrolling endlessly.\
Sometimes after completing yet another "productive" day.

"What have I actually been doing all this time?"

Not in a regretful way.\
Not in a defeated way.\
But in a deeply reflective way.

This blog is my attempt to answer that question --- honestly,
imperfectly, and without filters.

As a [founder](https://vijaykumargupta.in/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://vijaykumargupta.in/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank"}.\
As a Gen Z professional.\
As someone working in
[cybersecurity](https://einitial24.com/category/cybersecurity/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://einitial24.com/category/cybersecurity/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} in a world that barely understands it.

### The Illusion of Instant Success {#ac1d .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="ac1d"}

We grew up watching highlights.

Instagram reels of overnight success.\
Twitter threads of "I made \$100k in 30 days."\
LinkedIn posts that start with *"I never thought this would happen..."*

As Gen Z, we were taught that speed equals intelligence.\
That virality equals validation.\
That visibility equals value.

But real work rarely looks good on camera.

Most of the time, it looks like confusion.\
Trial and error.\
Unpaid learning.\
Late nights with no applause.

So when I ask myself what I've been doing all this time, the first
answer is simple:

**I've been unlearning the lies.**

### Learning Before Anyone Was Watching {#eb11 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="eb11"}

Before the followers.\
Before the podcasts.\
Before the "founder" title.

There was just curiosity.

Cybersecurity wasn't glamorous.\
No one in my circle really understood it.\
"[Is it
hacking](https://einitial24.com/ethical-hacking-course/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://einitial24.com/ethical-hacking-course/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}?"\
"Is it IT?"\
"Is it even legal?"

But I stayed.

I stayed because the internet fascinated me.\
Because systems breaking intrigued me.\
Because security was never about tools --- it was about mindset.

I spent years learning quietly.

Reading documentation no one recommends.\
Testing things that never worked the first time.\
Breaking things.\
Fixing them again.

No certificates posted.\
No viral threads.\
Just skill accumulation.

Looking back, those silent years matter more than anything visible
today.

### Wearing Multiple Hats Before It Was Cool {#c3a7 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="c3a7"}

Founder.\
 Marketer.\
 Cybersecurity analyst.\
 Content writer.\
 Trainer.\
 Podcast host.

At different times, all of them felt overwhelming.

I didn't start with a team.\
I didn't start with funding.\
I started with responsibility.

When you're building from zero, you don't get to specialize early.\
 You do what's needed.

One day you're securing systems.\
The next day you're designing a landing page.\
The next day you're writing content at midnight because outsourcing
isn't an option.

So if you ask what I've been doing all this time ---

**I've been surviving while building.**

And that takes more courage than most people admit.

### The Gen Z Conflict: Purpose vs Pressure {#75cb .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="75cb"}

Gen Z is often misunderstood.

We're called impatient.\
Distracted.\
Entitled.

But the truth is --- we're deeply conflicted.

We want purpose, not just paychecks.\
Impact, not just increments.\
Freedom, not just job titles.

At the same time, we feel intense pressure.

Pressure to succeed early.\
Pressure to prove ourselves.\
Pressure to not "waste potential."

So we experiment.

We try things.\
We fail publicly.\
We pivot often.

Cybersecurity gave me structure.\
Entrepreneurship gave me chaos.

Living between the two taught me balance.

### Cybersecurity Isn't Just a Career --- It's a Responsibility {#cae8 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="cae8"}

Most people see cybersecurity as a job.

I don't.

It's a responsibility.

Every vulnerability left unfixed is a future breach.\
Every untrained user is a potential victim.\
Every ignored alert is a missed warning.

Working in this field changes how you see the world.

You stop trusting blindly.\
You question defaults.\
You understand how fragile systems really are.

Over time, cybersecurity stopped being just technical for me.

It became educational.\
It became awareness-driven.\
It became community-focused.

That's when content creation entered naturally.

### Why I Started Creating Content {#1f50 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="1f50"}

Not to go viral.\
Not to build a "personal brand."

I started because I was tired of misinformation.

Cybersecurity was being sold as:

• Do this certification\
• Learn this tool\
• Follow this roadmap

But no one talked about mindset.\
No one talked about real struggles.\
No one talked about failure.

So I shared what I was learning.

Sometimes confidently.\
Sometimes vulnerably.

And slowly, people started resonating.

That's when I realized something important:

**Teaching is also a form of mastery.**

### Building Without Validation {#01fa .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="01fa"}

There were long periods with:

No engagement.\
No clients.\
No traction.

Just effort.

And effort without validation is the hardest kind.

But those phases shaped discipline.

They taught me consistency without dopamine.\
They taught me to detach from metrics.\
They taught me to trust process over applause.

If I had stopped during those quiet phases, nothing else would have
followed.

So when I ask what I've been doing all this time ---

**I've been showing up even when it didn't make sense.**

### The Founder Reality Nobody Posts About {#da9d .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="da9d"}

Being a founder isn't freedom at first.

It's responsibility multiplied.

You worry about:

Cash flow.\
Credibility.\
Delivery.\
Reputation.

You doubt yourself more than others do.\
You replay conversations.\
You overthink decisions.

But you also grow faster than you ever would in comfort.

You learn people skills.\
Negotiation.\
Leadership.\
Decision-making under uncertainty.

These are lessons no course can teach.

### Building Something Bigger Than Me {#284b .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="284b"}

Over time, the vision evolved.

It wasn't just about me anymore.

It became about:

• Creating awareness\
 • Building ethical tech education\
 • Making cybersecurity accessible\
 • Helping beginners avoid scams and shortcuts

That's when things like academies, podcasts, collaborations, and
communities started forming.

Not perfectly.\
Not smoothly.\
But intentionally.

### The Mental Health Side No One Mentions {#8ce6 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="8ce6"}

Let's be honest.

Burnout happened.\
Self-doubt happened.\
Comparison happened.

Especially as Gen Z, constantly exposed to others "winning."

There were days I questioned everything.

Am I too slow?\
Am I doing enough?\
Am I behind?

But growth doesn't follow timelines --- it follows commitment.

And sometimes, rest is also progress.

### Redefining Success (Again) {#aadb .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="aadb"}

Success isn't fame.\
It isn't followers.\
It isn't revenue alone.

Success is alignment.

When what you do matches who you are.\
When your work doesn't feel like betrayal.\
When you can explain your journey without pretending.

I may not have arrived yet.

But I'm not lost anymore.

### So, What Have I Been Doing All This Time? {#038f .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="038f"}

I've been learning without shortcuts.\
I've been failing quietly.\
I've been building slowly.\
I've been choosing substance over speed.\
I've been growing skills before spotlight.

I've been becoming.

Not overnight.\
Not linearly.\
But intentionally.

### For Anyone Reading This and Wondering the Same {#387f .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="387f"}

If you're asking yourself this question ---

You're not late.\
You're not behind.\
You're not wasting time.

You're collecting experiences that will make sense later.

Stay curious.\
Stay ethical.\
Stay consistent.

And remember:

**Invisible progress is still progress.**

### Final Thought {#fb6d .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="fb6d"}

One day, this phase will make sense.

Until then, keep going.

Because what you're doing right now --- \
even if it feels messy --- \
is becoming the foundation of something meaningful.

And that's never wasted time.
