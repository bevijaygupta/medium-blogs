### 1. Understanding Bug Bounties and Pentesting {#57b2 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="57b2"}

Before diving into bug hunting or pentesting, it's essential to grasp
the difference between the two. **Bug bounties** are programs where
companies invite ethical hackers to find security vulnerabilities in
their applications or websites in exchange for a reward, which could
range from recognition to monetary compensation. **Pentesting**, on the
other hand, involves a structured security assessment of a system or
network, where testers simulate cyberattacks to identify and exploit
vulnerabilities.

While bug bounty hunters may work independently and submit reports to
platforms or directly to companies, penetration testers are often
employed by organizations to conduct security assessments. However, the
skills overlap greatly, and many successful bug bounty hunters start by
learning pentesting techniques.

### 2. Step 1: Learn the Basics of Web Security {#6e73 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="6e73"}

To succeed in bug bounties and pentesting, you must first understand the
underlying technology. Web applications are the primary targets for most
bug bounties, so you need to be familiar with how they work.

#### Web Application Architecture {#e1a2 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="e1a2"}

Web applications generally consist of:

- [**Frontend**: The interface the user interacts with (HTML, CSS,
  JavaScript).]{#4cea}
- [**Backend**: The server and database that handle the logic and data
  storage.]{#522e}
- [**APIs**: Application Programming Interfaces that allow different
  parts of the app to communicate with each other.]{#9d73}

Understanding the interaction between these components is crucial to
identify weak points.

#### Common Web Vulnerabilities {#d144 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="d144"}

Some of the most frequent web application vulnerabilities include:

- [**SQL Injection (SQLi)**: Manipulating database queries to gain
  unauthorized access to data.]{#a4d7}
- [**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Injecting malicious scripts into web
  pages viewed by other users.]{#622a}
- [**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Trick users into executing
  unwanted actions on a website where they are authenticated.]{#98dc}
- [**Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: Exploiting a server's
  functionality to make unauthorized network requests.]{#f16a}

### 3. Step 2: Build Your Hacker Mindset {#7af0 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="7af0"}

Bug hunting requires a unique mindset characterized by curiosity,
persistence, and a drive to solve complex puzzles. The following
qualities will help you thrive:

#### Research and Curiosity {#3f83 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="3f83"}

As a bug hunter, always stay updated with the latest vulnerabilities and
attack vectors. Follow security blogs, attend conferences, and
participate in the security community to learn about emerging threats.

#### Persistence and Patience {#6d52 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="6d52"}

It's rare to find a vulnerability on your first attempt. Some bug
hunters spend hours, even days, without discovering a single flaw.
Persistence is key.

### 4. Step 3: Setting Up Your Environment {#87d4 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="87d4"}

Before you begin, you need a safe and secure environment to test
vulnerabilities. Hacking real websites without permission is illegal.

  scanner.]{#a4fc}

#### Virtual Machines and Lab Setup {#d9ff .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--li name="d9ff"}

Create a virtual lab using platforms like **VirtualBox** or **VMware**.
You can also use platforms like **Hack The Box** or **VulnHub** to
practice legally in controlled environments.

### 5. Step 4: Reconnaissance {#d6f1 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="d6f1"}

Reconnaissance is the phase where you gather as much information as
possible about your target. There are two types:

#### Active Reconnaissance {#1612 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="1612"}

This involves interacting directly with the target system, such as
scanning for open ports or enumerating directories.

#### Passive Reconnaissance {#3599 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="3599"}

This involves gathering information without interacting directly with
the target, such as collecting details from public sources like DNS
records, job postings, and social media.

#### Tools for Recon {#8bf9 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="8bf9"}

- [**Amass**: A tool for mapping out the attack surface by identifying
  domains.]{#66ba}
- [**Sublist3r**: A tool for subdomain enumeration.]{#7f90}
- [**Shodan**: A search engine for internet-connected devices, which
  helps identify vulnerable systems.]{#4f72}

### 6. Step 5: Scanning and Enumeration {#f65d .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="f65d"}

Once you have gathered enough information, the next step is scanning and
enumerating the target for weaknesses.

#### Discovering Attack Surfaces {#b097 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="b097"}

During this phase, you'll scan the target for open ports, services, and
potential vulnerabilities.

#### Nmap, Nikto, Burp Suite {#5265 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="5265"}

- [**Nmap**: Great for port scanning and service discovery.]{#5efa}
