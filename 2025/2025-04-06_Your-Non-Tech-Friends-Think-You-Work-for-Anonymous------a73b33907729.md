### Your Non-Tech Friends Think You Work for Anonymous 😎💻 {#6515 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading .graf--title name="6515"}

Let's get one thing straight --- if you're reading this, chances are you
work in **cybersecurity**, **IT**, or **anything vaguely technical
involving computers**, and your friends *still* think you spend your
nights in a hoodie, in a dark room, hacking the Pentagon for fun.

You walk into a party, someone introduces you as,

> *"Yo, this is Rahul. He's a hacker, bro. He works for Anonymous or
> something."*

And suddenly, you're *the main character* of every 2000s hacker movie,
even though your biggest accomplishment this week was debugging a broken
script and finding a lost password in your email spam folder.

Let's break this down. Welcome to the **ultimate reality check** of what
it's really like being the "techie" among a bunch of people who think
**"Ping"** is a sport and **"IP"** stands for **Instagram Profile**.

### 1. It All Started With "Fix My Wi-Fi" {#7218 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="7218"}

It begins innocently. You're at your cousin's house and someone says,

<figure id="7a55" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p">
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*9hvBhqAKleL6AHg5"
class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*9hvBhqAKleL6AHg5" data-width="959"
data-height="388" />
</figure>

> *"Bro, you're good with computers, right? Can you fix my Wi-Fi?"*

You haven't even sat down, but sure. You check. The router is fine.\
 The problem?\
 **They weren't even connected to the right network.**

Fast forward two months, and now your *entire extended family* thinks
you can hack into NASA's satellite systems, but also reset their Gmail
passwords from memory.

"Oh my god, Neha! Don't mess with him! He works with Anonymous!"

Neha: "What's Anonymous?"

**Cue dramatic music.**

### 2. The Hoodie Stereotype 🧥 {#29d7 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="29d7"}

I made the mistake of wearing a black hoodie to a café while typing on
my laptop once.

<figure id="69e7" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p">
<img
src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*2SbWH4owwSWWEPNe.png"

data-width="600" data-height="394" />
</figure>

The barista looked nervous.\
 Some guy near me whispered, "He's probably hacking into the
government."

No, bro. I was literally **ordering biryani** from Swiggy and updating
my Google Sheets budget like a broke adult.

But yes, let's go with that. I'm a dangerous hacker --- but only when my
Google Meet camera is off and I'm full of caffeine.

### 3. "Can You Hack My Ex's Instagram?" {#3878 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="3878"}

Let's talk about *those friends*.\
 The ones who come out of nowhere, especially after a breakup.

<figure id="6c59" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p">

data-width="1022" data-height="805" />
</figure>

> *"Listen, bro. She blocked me on Insta. Can you hack her account? Just
> a little? I won't tell anyone."*

No, *Vikram*, I cannot commit **cybercrime** because you still have
feelings and a playlist named "Her 😔💔."

Do you also want me to install a keylogger on her dog's smart collar?
Should I launch a DDoS attack on her new boyfriend's LinkedIn?

Calm down, Romeo. Go to therapy.

### 4. "You Work With Computers? You Must Be Rich!" 💸 {#4099 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="4099"}

Ah yes, the assumption that because you "do something with computers,"
you're automatically making crores and working for some secret startup
that sells data to aliens.

<figure id="80e6" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p">

"No bro, you're lying. You have like 6 monitors and your chair is like
₹45,000. You're a hacker."

Dude, my *chair* is second-hand from OLX and one wheel is broken. My
monitors? One is actually a smart TV I got on sale during Diwali.

I *do* have 4 screens, yes --- but 3 of them are just showing memes and
YouTube tutorials I never finished.

### 5. Every Movie Reference is Your Life Now 🎬 {#11a4 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="11a4"}

Your friends think your life is a mix of:

<figure id="494e" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p">
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*dmjOSMvboD1LOuLb"
class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*dmjOSMvboD1LOuLb" data-width="284"
data-height="177" />
</figure>

- [**Mr. Robot**]{#128d}
- [**The Matrix**]{#2206}
- [**Fast & Furious: Hobbs and Shaw** (because why not?)]{#91c4}
- [And *that one episode* of Crime Patrol with a "cyber expert."]{#ddb1}

To them, you don't sleep. You sit in the dark, typing green code while
12 screens flash around you. You say things like:

> *"I'm in."\
>  "The firewall is compromised."\
>  "We've been breached."*

When in reality, your life looks more like:

> *"Why is this error not going away?"\
>  "Why did I forget to save the file?"\
>  "Why is the Wi-Fi down again?!"\
>  "Did I just reply-all to the entire company?!"*

### 6. "So You Work With Anonymous?" 🤔 {#637a .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="637a"}

Let's just talk about it.

<figure id="21e0" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p">
<img
src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*EKh-x-XAysob0lSh.png"
class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*EKh-x-XAysob0lSh.png"
data-width="720" data-height="1280" />
</figure>

You try to explain what you *actually* do:\
 "I'm a cybersecurity analyst. I monitor systems for threats and write
reports."

What they hear:\
 "I'm a top-tier hacker who works with Anonymous, leaks government
secrets, and knows Elon Musk's IP address."

One guy literally asked me,

> *"If you're not part of Anonymous, why do you wear dark clothes and
> have a beard?"*

**Bro.**\
 That's called *depression* and *budget fashion*. Not *international
hacktivism*.

### 7. You're the Family IT Helpdesk 📞 {#c22b .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="c22b"}

You're everyone's personal:

- [Antivirus]{#a445}
- [Phone technician]{#ac3e}
- [Laptop cleaner]{#c0f9}
- [Data recovery expert]{#cd78}
- [Printer whisperer]{#1f23}

**Fun fact:**\
 You don't even *own* a printer.\
 But guess who gets called at 2 AM when someone's printer is making
clicking sounds?

"Beta, ink khatam ho gaya kya?"

"I don't know, Aunty, I live 200 kilometers away."

### 8. The Only Crime You Commit is Debugging at 3 AM {#a9c8 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="a9c8"}

If being tired, drinking 5 cups of coffee, and writing logs that even
*you* can't understand counts as a crime, then yes --- I plead guilty.

Sometimes I stare at my code and it stares back.\
 Sometimes I fix one bug and five new ones appear like it's some kind of
mythical hydra.

But sure, I'm a "hacker."

### 9. Then Comes the Shocking Paycheck Talk {#86bf .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="86bf"}

When you finally tell your friends how much you earn, they're either:

- [Shocked that you don't make 10 lakhs per month, or]{#07bf}
- [Completely convinced you're lying to hide your crypto money.]{#073f}

Bro, I don't even have time to make a crypto wallet. I'm just trying to
meet my Jira deadlines and not get yelled at on Zoom.

### 10. You Accidentally Scare People Too {#8607 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="8607"}

"I saw your post on LinkedIn about phishing. Are you... watching me?"

No, Tina. That's your *Amazon Echo*.\
 I'm not spying on you. I'm just telling people not to click random
links like **"You won ₹5,000 from Paytm!"**

And when I explain **how easy it is to do social engineering**, everyone
in the room suddenly thinks I can read minds.

I can't, but I *can* guess your password is your pet's name plus 123.

### 11. The Unofficial God of Tech Support 👑 {#b58a .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="b58a"}

The moment anything doesn't work:

- [The TV remote]{#3b27}
- [The fan switch]{#8d9f}
- [The gas stove]{#32fd}

Guess who gets called?

> *"Hey, you work with computers na? Can you check my microwave
> settings?"*

What do you think I am --- **Google fused with Tony Stark**?

### 12. Random Strangers Ask for Help {#e295 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="e295"}

One time I said I worked in cybersecurity.\
 A random guy from the table next to me leaned in and said:

> *"Can you check if my wife is cheating on me? I just need a* little
> *hack."*

Bro.\
 This is CCD, not CSI.

### 13. You Can't Escape the Hacker Label 🕶️ {#e888 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="e888"}

No matter what you say, your non-tech friends will always think:

- [You can hack Facebook accounts in 2 minutes.]{#6664}
- [You know *all* the government secrets.]{#0b88}
- [You work for Anonymous.]{#7a7a}
- [And somehow --- you're *definitely* on a watchlist.]{#682b}

### 14. But Hey, You Love It... Kinda {#3764 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="3764"}

Even with all the memes, jokes, and *utter misinterpretation* of your
job, it *does* feel good when someone calls you "the smart one."

Even when your mom introduces you as:

> *"Yeh mera beta hai. Computer ka scientist hai. NASA me kaam karta
> tha."*

Thanks, mom. I just reset your Jio router yesterday, but yes --- let's
go with NASA.

### 15. Final Thoughts (and a Friendly PSA) {#67b1 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="67b1"}

To all the non-tech folks out there reading this:

- [No, your techie friend is not a hacker (probably).]{#03f7}
- [No, we don't work for Anonymous.]{#e2cd}
- [No, we can't fix your toaster.]{#6a7e}
- [No, we don't want to hack your ex's DMs.]{#4956}
- [And please, stop saying "I don't know anything about tech" while
  using 3 phones, 2 smartwatches, and complaining about your slow
  iPad.]{#2d9a}

To all the techies:\
 Stay strong. Drink your coffee. Explain things like you're talking to a
golden retriever (with love). And wear that hoodie proudly --- even if
you're just watching Netflix.

And remember:

> *You might not be in Anonymous.\
>  But to your non-tech friends,\
>  You ARE the Anonymous. 😎*

**Author's Note:**\
 I wrote this blog during my third cup of coffee, while explaining to my
friend that **"clear cache"** doesn't mean deleting memories. If you're
a tech person, share this with your non-tech friends. If you're a
non-tech person, please stop asking us to hack the exam portal. 🙏
