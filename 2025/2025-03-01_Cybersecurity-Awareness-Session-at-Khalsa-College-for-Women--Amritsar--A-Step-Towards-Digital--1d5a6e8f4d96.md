### Introduction {#2af0 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--figure name="2af0"}

In an era where digital threats are growing at an unprecedented rate,
cybersecurity awareness has become a necessity rather than an option. I
recently had the **honor of conducting a Cybersecurity Awareness Session
at Khalsa College for Women, Amritsar**, on behalf of **Cyint
Technologies**. This session was aimed at equipping students with
essential cybersecurity knowledge to protect themselves from cyber
threats and navigate the digital world safely.

### The Importance of Cybersecurity Awareness {#8931 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--figure name="8931"}

Cyber threats such as phishing, identity theft, malware attacks, and
social engineering are on the rise. According to recent statistics,
**82% of data breaches occur due to human error**, highlighting the
urgent need for cybersecurity training.

With the increasing reliance on digital platforms for education,
business, and personal activities, understanding cybersecurity
fundamentals has become critical. **Cybercriminals target individuals
who lack awareness**, making it essential for students, professionals,
and everyday internet users to be well-informed.

Educational institutions play a vital role in fostering cybersecurity
awareness. Integrating **cybersecurity education into school and college
curriculums** can significantly reduce cybercrime risks in the long run.
Initiatives like **Cyber Sainik**, which aims to train **25,000 students
in cybersecurity over three years**, are crucial steps towards a more
secure digital environment.

response. Students actively participated, shared their concerns about
online security, and asked insightful questions. The engagement
demonstrated a clear **interest and necessity for such awareness
programs**.

Many students expressed their gratitude for the practical insights
shared, and some even showed enthusiasm about pursuing careers in
cybersecurity. This highlights the need for **more frequent awareness
sessions** across various educational institutions.

### Conclusion {#3442 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="3442"}

Cybersecurity is not just a technical concern --- it is a **shared
responsibility**. With the increasing number of cyber threats, spreading
awareness and equipping individuals with the necessary skills to **stay
safe online is crucial**.

I am grateful for the opportunity to represent **Cyint Technologies**
and contribute towards **creating a more cyber-aware society**. Let's
