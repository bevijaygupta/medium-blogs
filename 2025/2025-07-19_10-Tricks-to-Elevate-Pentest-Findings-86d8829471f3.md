Pentesting is more than just running scanners and submitting raw
vulnerability reports. To stand out as a penetration tester, you must go
beyond what automated tools reveal. You need to think like an attacker,
chain vulnerabilities together, and extract maximum impact from
seemingly low-risk issues. Here's a deep dive into 10 techniques that
can turn your average pentest finding into a critical report-worthy
exploit.

**1. HTML Injection → SSRF via**

At first glance, HTML Injection might not seem critical. But if you find
this vulnerability in a document viewer or a reporting tool, you can use
the `<iframe>`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} tag to load internal
resources.

Imagine this: An application displays HTML content from user input. You
inject
`<iframe src="http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/">`{.markup--code
.markup--p-code} and suddenly, the application starts making server-side
requests to cloud metadata services. This opens the door to SSRF
(Server-Side Request Forgery).

It's an elegant trick that elevates a simple injection into a path for
accessing internal infrastructure or credentials stored in cloud
metadata.

**2. Open Redirect → Account Takeover**

Open Redirects are often dismissed as harmless, but in real-world
attacks, they're incredibly useful. Combine an open redirect with a
phishing campaign or OAuth abuse and you've got a full-blown account
takeover vector.

Imagine a user is redirected from a trusted application to a malicious
domain. The attacker captures their access token or session, especially
in OAuth flows where redirection URIs are poorly validated.

This simple redirect suddenly becomes a critical issue, especially when
user trust is leveraged against them.

**3. CSRF → Privilege Escalation**

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is another vulnerability often
overlooked. But if you discover CSRF on endpoints that change user
roles, passwords, or emails, you've hit gold.

For instance, if an admin panel doesn't have CSRF protection on a
"change role" form, an attacker can craft a hidden form that submits a
role escalation request on behalf of an unsuspecting admin.

With one malicious email or link click, you might just become the new
admin. That's not just a CSRF issue anymore; it's a privilege escalation
flaw.

**4. SSRF (GET) → Read Confidential Data**

SSRF vulnerabilities let attackers force the server to make HTTP
requests to internal or external systems. When it allows GET requests,
you can often access internal web apps, databases, or metadata services.

A classic target is the AWS metadata endpoint:
`http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`{.markup--code
.markup--p-code}. If your GET request is processed by the backend and
the response is visible, you\'re just steps away from stealing IAM
credentials.

Low-risk SSRF? More like high-impact data breach.

**5. SSRF (POST) → RCE**

If SSRF allows POST requests, you have something powerful. POST requests
mean you can interact with internal services that expect JSON or form
data.

Some internal APIs offer functions like deploying scripts, triggering
backups, or executing commands. SSRF to these can lead to RCE (Remote
Code Execution), especially in internal CI/CD systems like Jenkins or
APIs with known vulnerabilities.

This is the type of finding that gets attention from DevOps and security
teams alike.

**6. CORS Misconfiguration → Token Theft / API Abuse**

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a critical browser feature that
allows or blocks web apps from accessing data on another domain. When
CORS is misconfigured, and especially if the server reflects arbitrary
origins and allows credentials, attackers can exploit it.

Imagine you host a malicious site, and the vulnerable application
reflects your origin with
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://evil.com`{.markup--code
.markup--p-code} and sends
`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`{.markup--code .markup--p-code}.
This lets you steal tokens, API keys, or sensitive data from
authenticated sessions.

From a misconfig to full cross-origin hijacking, this one is deadly when
abused.

**7. JWT Misconfig → Authentication Bypass**

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are often used for session management and user
authentication. A misconfigured JWT implementation can let attackers
forge valid tokens.

Some common tricks include:

- [Changing the algorithm to `none`{.markup--code .markup--li-code},
  bypassing signature verification.]{#7043}
- [Using the public key in HMAC mode (instead of RSA) to sign
  tokens.]{#5b28}

By tampering with JWT headers and payloads, you can impersonate admin
users and access restricted areas without credentials.

**8. Insecure Deserialization → RCE**

When applications unserialize untrusted user input without proper
checks, it leads to serious issues. Attackers can craft serialized
objects that execute arbitrary code upon deserialization.

This vulnerability is often found in cookies, session tokens, or hidden
form fields. If you detect insecure deserialization, use tools like
`ysoserial`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} to create payloads and gain
command execution.

In Java, PHP, Python, and .NET apps, this flaw has caused major breaches
and deserves attention.

**9. Rate Limit Bypass → 2FA Bypass**

Rate limiting is often the only defense between an attacker and a
brute-force attack. If you find that OTPs or login endpoints lack rate
limiting, you're staring at an opportunity to bypass multi-factor
authentication (2FA).

Try common OTP brute force tools or create custom scripts to test
limits. Even a small window (like 5 seconds without throttling) can be
enough for attackers to crack weak 6-digit codes.

Don't underestimate this. It's how attackers break into "secure"
accounts.

**10. Race Condition → Limit Abuse**

A race condition happens when multiple requests hit the server at the
same time, and the backend fails to handle them in a synchronized
manner.

Abuse this to:

- [Redeem the same coupon code multiple times]{#a280}
- [Bypass payment systems]{#75f8}
- [Escalate privileges or submit duplicate transactions]{#8d96}

Use tools like `burp intruder`{.markup--code .markup--p-code},
`turbo intruder`{.markup--code .markup--p-code}, or custom
multi-threaded scripts to exploit these flaws.

In real-world engagements, this turns business logic bugs into severe
abuse scenarios.

**Final Thoughts: Elevate Your Game**

Pentesting isn't just about finding vulnerabilities --- it's about
showing their real-world impact. When you take basic issues and chain
them into attack paths, you prove value to clients and make your reports
truly actionable.

So the next time you find an HTML injection, open redirect, or CORS
misconfig, don't just report it as-is. Think about how it could be
exploited further. Context is king. Impact is everything.

Use these 10 tricks to level up your findings, impress stakeholders, and
most importantly, make applications safer.

Stay sharp, think offensively.
