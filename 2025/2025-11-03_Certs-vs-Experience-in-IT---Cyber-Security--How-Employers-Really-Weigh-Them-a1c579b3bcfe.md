When I started my journey in cybersecurity, I believed one thing with
all my heart --- *the more certifications I get, the faster I'll grow.*

And honestly, I wasn't completely wrong. Certifications *did* open
doors. They gave me credibility, especially when I had nothing else to
show.

But as I grew --- from being a learner, to working on real-world
projects, to running my own digital marketing and cybersecurity training
company --- I realized something uncomfortable:

**Certifications get you noticed. Experience gets you hired.**

Both are valuable, but the way employers weigh them is far more nuanced
than what you read online.

Let's unpack this --- honestly, from the lens of someone who's been on
both sides of the table: the learner and the founder, the employee and
the employer.

### 1. The Certification Dream {#5458 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="5458"}

If you've ever searched "[best cybersecurity
certifications](https://einitial24.com/category/cybersecurity/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://einitial24.com/category/cybersecurity/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}," you've probably seen a list that looks
like a Pokémon collection:

- [CompTIA Security+]{#7c5f}
- [CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker)]{#af44}
- [CISSP]{#ebc0}
- [OSCP]{#0e3c}
- [CHFI]{#0524}
- [CISM]{#9cf0}
- [ISO 27001 Lead Auditor]{#9fab}

And the list goes on.

Each certification promises something --- credibility, better salary,
respect, recognition, and of course, a "foot in the door."

And to be fair, that's what they actually provide --- a *foot in the
door.*

Certifications tell employers: *"I'm serious about this field."* They
demonstrate discipline, basic knowledge, and commitment.

For someone switching careers or starting out after college, they're
like a shortcut to visibility.

### 2. The Experience Reality {#d896 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="d896"}

But once that door opens, your *real test* begins.

Employers --- especially in cybersecurity --- care about **proof of
skill.**

They want to know if you can *actually* secure a network, analyze logs,
identify vulnerabilities, or handle a live attack.

Certifications teach you theory. Experience teaches you *context.*

I've seen candidates who could recite CEH modules perfectly but couldn't
recognize a phishing attempt or interpret a firewall rule.

On the other hand, I've met self-taught ethical hackers who never passed
a single exam but could dissect a system blindfolded.

So when an employer looks at your résumé, they're not just asking:

> *"What do you know?"\
>  They're asking:\
>  "Can you do it when it actually matters?"*

### 3. Why the Confusion Exists {#466a .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--blockquote name="466a"}

The confusion between "certs vs experience" comes from how the industry
evolved.

A decade ago, certifications were rare --- and having one really made
you stand out. But today, **everyone has at least one.**

It's not uncommon to see freshers stacking 5--6 certifications on their
LinkedIn profile --- yet struggling to explain what a port scan does.

Employers noticed that.

So, the weight of certifications has slowly decreased. They're still
*necessary*, but they're no longer *enough.*

Now, employers look for proof of real-world involvement:

- [Capture The Flag (CTF) participation]{#f210}
- [Bug bounty reports]{#0291}
- [GitHub or portfolio projects]{#b76c}
- [Internships, even unpaid ones]{#9f50}
- [Case studies or problem-solving demonstrations]{#a3d9}

Basically --- **show, don't tell.**

### 4. What Employers Really Think {#52dc .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="52dc"}

Let me speak honestly as a founder.

When I hire someone for my cybersecurity or digital marketing team, I
don't ignore certifications. They still matter --- but they're just one
*signal.*

Here's how I really weigh them:

### → If you're a beginner {#c67f .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="c67f"}

Certifications show that you've invested in yourself. I'll take that as
a good sign.\
 But I'll still test your practical thinking.

I might ask:

- [How would you secure a WordPress website?]{#b737}
- [How do you detect a phishing email?]{#32fe}
- [Can you show me one vulnerability you found in a test lab?]{#7fdf}

I'm not expecting perfection --- I'm expecting *clarity.*

### → If you're intermediate {#1169 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="1169"}

Now I expect you to have *some* project or internship experience.\
 A certification alone won't convince me that you can handle clients,
incidents, or deadlines.

Show me something tangible:

- [A GitHub repo]{#97a0}
- [A blog explaining your approach]{#b20f}
- [Screenshots from your home lab\
   That's worth more than a piece of paper.]{#0db9}

### → If you're advanced {#7c99 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="7c99"}

At this point, experience outweighs everything.

You could have no certs but have handled a live ransomware case, done
penetration testing for startups, or built your own SOC tools --- that's
gold.

I'll hire you faster than someone with ten framed certificates and zero
scars from the field.

### 5. The "Certification Trap" {#81d1 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="81d1"}

Let's be real --- certifications are a business.

The IT industry has monetized learning. Every year, new versions are
released, new study guides are published, and new exams are launched.

I've seen students take loans to chase certifications they don't even
need for their current goals.

And here's the trap:\
 They mistake **learning** for **progress.**

You can study for months and still not grow if you don't *apply* what
you learn.

I tell my students at einital24 Academy this often:

> *"You can't hack a system you've never touched. You can't defend a
> network you've never built."*

Stop collecting certs like trophies. Build something instead.

Run a lab.\
 Volunteer for a local startup's security audit.\
 Participate in open-source projects.\
 Write about your findings.

Because in 2025, *experience is the new certification.*

### 6. The Power of Projects {#985e .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="985e"}

Let me give you an example.

I once interviewed two candidates for a cybersecurity intern role.

Candidate A had **CEH + CHFI + ISO 27001**, but no practical exposure.

Candidate B had **only one course certificate** but had:

- [A working home lab setup]{#9000}
- [A GitHub profile with scripts and notes]{#433b}
- [A blog explaining how he exploited a vulnerable machine on
  TryHackMe]{#5454}

Guess who got the offer?

Candidate B --- without hesitation.

Why?\
 Because his **proof of execution** outweighed theoretical knowledge.

Employers today want someone who can *get their hands dirty.* Someone
who can *think independently.*

Certs tell me you've studied.\
 Experience tells me you've *struggled.*\
 And those struggles shape real cybersecurity professionals.

### 7. When Certifications Actually Matter {#e125 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="e125"}

Now, let's not throw certifications under the bus. They do matter --- a
lot --- **in specific contexts.**

### → For compliance-driven roles {#1fc2 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="1fc2"}

If you're working with government contracts, defense, or corporate audit
roles, certifications like CISSP, CISM, or ISO are *mandatory.*\
 They're required for documentation, tenders, and compliance processes.

### → For HR screening {#f4ba .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="f4ba"}

Big corporations often use ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems). These tools
scan résumés for keywords like "CEH," "Security+," or "CISSP."

So if you want to make it past the first filter --- you'll need at least
one major certification.

### → For credibility in freelancing or teaching {#190b .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="190b"}

If you're starting your own consulting, freelancing, or teaching
business (like I did), certifications act as trust signals.\
 They help clients feel confident that you know what you're talking
about.

So yes --- they're still powerful tools.\
 Just not substitutes for experience.

### 8. The Digital Marketing Parallel {#b97f .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="b97f"}

Since I also come from a digital marketing background, let me make a
comparison.

In digital marketing, you'll find people with Google Ads, HubSpot, and
Meta certifications everywhere.\
 But what separates the best marketers? Their *case studies.*

The same rule applies in cybersecurity.

Both industries are filled with "certified professionals" --- but only a
few can actually *deliver results.*

An employer or client doesn't care how many certifications you have.\
 They care about one thing:

> *"Can you solve my problem?"*

That's the ultimate metric.

### 9. Building Experience When You Don't Have a Job {#0d7c .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="0d7c"}

Here's a common question I get from beginners:

> *"How do I gain experience if no one hires me without experience?"*

Fair question. Here's how you do it --- step by step.

### Step 1: Build a Home Lab {#9487 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="9487"}

Use VirtualBox or VMware to set up your own mini-network.\
 Practice:

- [Penetration testing on vulnerable machines (Metasploitable, DVWA,
  OWASP Juice Shop)]{#4615}
- [Network monitoring using Wireshark]{#00bb}
- [Incident handling simulations]{#7850}

Document everything.

### Step 2: Join CTFs and Bug Bounties {#a1e9 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="a1e9"}

Websites like TryHackMe, Hack The Box, and HackerOne can help you gain
real experience.\
 Each solved challenge = one more skill to your résumé.

### Step 3: Volunteer {#3ea5 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="3ea5"}

Offer to secure local businesses, NGOs, or startups.\
 You'll learn *faster than any certification course.*

### Step 4: Document Publicly {#9fd4 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="9fd4"}

Start a blog or LinkedIn series about your learnings.\
 Employers love candidates who share their thought process.

### Step 5: Combine It All {#ef8a .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="ef8a"}

By the time you apply for a job, you'll have:

- [Projects]{#e200}
- [Writeups]{#c999}
- [Hands-on proof]{#f021}

And trust me --- *that's what gets you shortlisted.*

### 10. How to Choose Between Certs and Experience {#eee9 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="eee9"}

If you're still confused about which to prioritize, use this framework:

<figure id="6264" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p">
<img
src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*nSyu2m1kItsbk14o2Laa6Q.png"
class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*nSyu2m1kItsbk14o2Laa6Q.png"
data-width="943" data-height="220" />
</figure>

The balance changes as you grow.

When you're new, you need something to *signal intent.*\
 But once you've proven your skill, your portfolio does all the talking.

### 11. The Employer's Dilemma {#d924 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="d924"}

Let me share something most companies won't say out loud.

Hiring managers often face this dilemma:

- [Candidate A: Certified, but inexperienced.]{#2023}
- [Candidate B: Uncertified, but practical.]{#e173}

If I'm hiring for a *hands-on role* (like penetration testing, SOC
analyst, or forensics investigator), I'll go for Candidate B.

But if it's a *client-facing or compliance-driven* position (like ISO
audits or risk management), I'll go for Candidate A.

So, context decides the weight of each.

There's no one-size-fits-all rule.

### 12. The Founder's Perspective {#32dd .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="32dd"}

As a founder, I've learned that what matters most isn't what's written
on paper --- it's what happens when things go wrong.

When a client's website gets hacked at 2 AM, I don't ask my team,

> *"Who has the most certifications?"*

I ask,

> *"Who can fix this right now?"*

That's the difference between theory and practice.

Certifications look great on LinkedIn.\
 Experience looks great in emergencies.

And as much as we romanticize knowledge, **execution always wins.**

### 13. The Emotional Side No One Talks About {#ade9 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="ade9"}

Behind every certification is anxiety --- the pressure to prove your
worth.

Many students chase certs not because they love learning, but because
they fear being left behind.

They compare themselves with others on LinkedIn, thinking:

> *"He has CEH and OSCP. I should get one too."*

But here's the truth:

> You're not competing with them. You're competing with your yesterday.

Certifications don't define you. Your curiosity does.\
 Your willingness to learn, build, fail, and rebuild --- that's what
employers notice.

So, take the pressure off. Learn because you want to *understand,* not
because you want to *impress.*

### 14. My Personal Journey {#3925 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="3925"}

When I first started teaching ethical hacking, I had a few
certifications. But what built my credibility wasn't those --- it was
**the workshops, live demos, and real incidents I handled.**

Once, a client's e-commerce site was hit by a brute-force attack. My
team stayed up the entire night monitoring logs, changing
configurations, and blocking malicious IPs manually.

The next morning, the attack stopped.

No certification could've prepared me for that.\
 Only *doing the work* could.

That's when I realized --- experience is what shapes mastery.

### 15. The Future of Hiring in Cybersecurity {#1196 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="1196"}

The hiring landscape is changing fast.

Employers are slowly moving from **degree-driven hiring** to
**skill-based hiring.**

Platforms like TryHackMe, GitHub, and Hack The Box are becoming the new
résumé.\
 Your portfolio is becoming your passport.

In 2025 and beyond, the candidates who will stand out are:

- [Those who can demonstrate live skills.]{#be8e}
- [Those who can document their learning publicly.]{#4287}
- [Those who combine certification *and* creativity.]{#7aab}

So if you're reading this --- the smartest move you can make is to
**blend both.**

Earn certifications strategically.\
 But spend more time building, experimenting, and sharing.

### 16. The Balanced Path Forward {#4dd1 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="4dd1"}

Here's how I guide my students and team members today:

1.  [**Start with one foundational certification.**\
     Something like CompTIA Security+ or CEH to validate your
    basics.]{#63ed}
2.  [**Build your hands-on experience simultaneously.**\
     Don't wait till "after your exam" to start practicing.]{#8f4f}
3.  [**Document everything you learn.**\
     Create blogs, threads, or short videos explaining your
    process.]{#dfdc}
4.  [**Focus on one domain deeply.**\
     Whether it's penetration testing, SOC analysis, or forensics --- go
    all in.]{#6df7}
5.  [**Use your certifications as bridges, not destinations.**\
     Let them help you reach the next phase, not define your entire
    journey.]{#db93}

That's the formula that actually works.

### 17. Final Thoughts {#ddc8 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="ddc8"}

In the battle between **Certifications vs Experience**, the winner isn't
one over the other --- it's **how you combine both.**

Certifications give you entry.\
 Experience gives you authority.

But remember:

- [Certifications expire.]{#6bc2}
- [Experience compounds.]{#41ce}

The real experts I've met in cybersecurity didn't just collect
badges --- they collected stories.\
 Stories of systems they broke, defended, and rebuilt.

So, don't chase paper. Chase progress.

Because in this ever-changing digital world, the people who *do the
work* --- not just *learn the work* --- will always stay in demand.

### If You're Just Starting Out {#dff9 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="dff9"}

Don't get stuck deciding between certs or experience. Start *doing.*\
 Learn. Break. Fix. Repeat.

And when you look back a few years later, you'll realize something
beautiful --- \
 you didn't need to choose. You just needed to begin.
