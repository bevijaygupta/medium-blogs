I recently met up with my friend Gaurav, a freelance graphic designer
and part-time cybersecurity consultant. We've known each other since
college --- back when surviving on instant noodles and pirated Adobe
software was a shared lifestyle choice. Now, a few years into adulthood,
I noticed something peculiar about Gaurav's daily routine.

Every morning, without fail, he packs his laptop, charger, a sleek
little USB key, and heads straight to a café. Not just any café --- his
favorite one, where the Wi-Fi password hasn't changed in years and the
barista knows his coffee order by heart.

So, one morning, I finally asked him.

> *"Dude, you work in tech and cyber, and yet you* choose *to sit in a
> place with public Wi-Fi and distractions. Why?"*

What followed was a two-hour rant --- half therapy, half cybersecurity
TED talk --- and I walked away with a totally different perspective.

Here's what he said, broken down in short (and slightly caffeinated)
paragraphs.

### 1. The Myth of Home Productivity {#eb3b .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="eb3b"}

"I used to work from home," Gaurav confessed, sipping his long black.
"It started off like a dream --- no commute, no pants, no managers
peeking over your shoulder."

But soon, the dream turned dystopian.

> *"My bed became my desk. My desk became my dining table. I wasn't
> working from home --- I was living at work."*

He tried everything --- Pomodoro apps, noise-cancelling headphones,
motivational quotes on sticky notes. But nothing replaced the
psychological shift of physically *going somewhere* to work.

"And let's not even talk about the 3 PM existential dread," he added.
"That hits harder when you haven't spoken to a human all day."

### 2. The Café Is a "Controlled Chaos" Zone {#9cac .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="9cac"}

Contrary to popular belief, Gaurav doesn't see cafés as chaotic.

"They're *predictably* noisy," he said. "And that's perfect. Unlike
home, where a phone call or the neighbor's drilling can yank me out of
focus, the background hum here actually helps."

Turns out, this has a name: **"The Coffee Shop Effect"** --- ambient
noise that boosts creativity and focus. There's even science to back
this up.

> *"The café becomes my coworking space, minus the monthly
> subscription."*

### 3. The Secret Cybersecurity Weapon: "Being Watched" {#f032 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--blockquote name="f032"}

Now here's where it got interesting --- and unexpectedly *cybersecure*.

Gaurav leaned in and said, "There's something about having people around
you, watching, that keeps you accountable. But more than that --- it
keeps you **aware**."

He explained how working at home made him complacent. He left sensitive
documents open, walked away from his screen unlocked, and sometimes
forgot to update his antivirus. At the café?

> *"I* have *to be on alert. I'm constantly scanning my surroundings,
> locking my screen when I step away, using my VPN religiously."*

**The café forces good cyber hygiene** because the risk of shoulder
surfing or someone stealing your device is very real.

### 4. VPNs Are Like Condoms --- Always Use One in Public {#717f .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="717f"}

Gaurav's golden rule: "Never trust public Wi-Fi. Ever."

"People think just because the café gave them a password, it's safe.
That's like assuming everyone at a party is sober because there's a
bouncer."

He uses a premium VPN every single time. No exceptions.

> *"And I don't mean those free Chrome extension scams. I pay for mine,
> because I value my data more than ₹300 a month."*

He also uses a **hardware firewall key**, like the
[Firewalla](https://firewalla.com/){.markup--anchor .markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://firewalla.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"} or
[Yubikey](https://www.yubico.com/){.markup--anchor .markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://www.yubico.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, to
keep any unsolicited connections at bay.

### 5. Shoulder Surfing Is Real (And Creepy) {#086e .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="086e"}

"You'd be shocked how many people read your screen in public," Gaurav
said.

So he uses a **privacy screen filter** --- a physical film that makes
his screen only visible when viewed straight on. Sit next to him at the
wrong angle, and you'll see a black mirror instead of his Trello board.

> *"One time, I caught a guy snapping a photo of my screen while
> pretending to take a selfie. Never again."*

And yes, if you think that only happens in movies --- you haven't spent
enough time freelancing in public spaces.

### 6. Cafés as Soft Targets for Cybercriminals {#4293 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="4293"}

Gaurav didn't sugarcoat it.

"Cafés are hacker playgrounds," he warned. "You've got unpatched
devices, open networks, and zero cybersecurity awareness."

In fact, he once did a passive scan of devices connected to the same
Wi-Fi network (with permission from the café owner, of course). The
results were terrifying:

- [Dozens of devices with **outdated operating systems**]{#7199}
- [Exposed **file-sharing settings**]{#76fd}
- [Unencrypted web traffic]{#c3fe}

> *"If I were a black hat, I'd never need to leave this café to make a
> living."*

That's why he always disables Bluetooth and AirDrop, sets his Wi-Fi to
not auto-connect, and uses MFA on every account.

### 7. Backups --- Because Lattes Spill Too {#6ce1 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="6ce1"}

One day, someone bumped into Gaurav's table. His laptop nearly drowned
in mocha.

"From that day, I started backing up everything --- twice."

He uses **encrypted cloud backups** (with zero-knowledge providers like
Tresorit) and also carries an encrypted USB SSD. Because in the café
world, coffee accidents are more common than cyber attacks.

> *"You can't restore client trust, but you* can *restore files --- if
> you planned ahead."*

### 8. Emotional Safety Is a Kind of Cybersecurity Too {#6da2 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--blockquote name="6da2"}

This was the part that hit me hardest.

"I work at cafés because it protects my *mental health*. And mental
health *is* cybersecurity."

Working from home isolated him. And isolation led to burnout. Burnout
made him sloppy --- he clicked links without thinking, skipped software
updates, reused passwords.

> *"Your mental state affects your digital behavior. No one talks about
> this enough."*

At the café, the human presence --- however subtle --- keeps him
*anchored*.

Even if it's just a nod from the barista or overhearing two strangers
argue about oat milk.

### 9. He Chooses His Cafés Carefully (Here's His Vetting List) {#a735 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="a735"}

Not all cafés are created equal, especially if you're working on
sensitive stuff.

Here's Gaurav's personal checklist:

✅ Strong Wi-Fi (but not *too* crowded)\
 ✅ Outlets near tables\
 ✅ Staff he trusts\
 ✅ No sketchy routers lying around\
 ✅ Good coffee (obviously)\
 ✅ Friendly crowd, not full of selfie-takers\
 ✅ Location with low crime rate\
 ✅ Physical seating arrangement that lets him sit with his back to the
wall

> *"I like seeing who enters and exits. Basic OPSEC."*

### 10. Home Is for Living, Not Just Working {#038d .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--blockquote name="038d"}

Lastly, Gaurav said something I won't forget:

> *"I stopped working from home because I wanted to love my home
> again."*

When your house becomes your office, it's hard to relax. Your brain
associates your couch with client calls, your kitchen with deadlines,
and your bed with Zoom meetings.

The café gives him **boundaries**.

And boundaries, my friend, are the best firewall of all.

### Conclusion: He's Not Weird, He's Wired Differently {#5d98 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="5d98"}

After that conversation, I saw Gaurav differently.

He's not just a freelance guy sipping overpriced coffee.

He's someone who actively curates his environment --- both physical and
digital --- to stay productive *and* secure.

So the next time you walk into a café and see someone typing away behind
a privacy screen, connected to a VPN, sipping coffee with
purpose --- don't assume they're escaping work.

They're probably **doing it better than you.**
