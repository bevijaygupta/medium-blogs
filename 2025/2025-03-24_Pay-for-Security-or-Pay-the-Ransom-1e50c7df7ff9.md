### The Harsh Reality of Cybersecurity Salaries {#a8a7 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--figure name="a8a7"}

Companies love to say that cybersecurity is a priority. They love to
boast about how much they care about data protection, compliance, and
keeping their systems secure. But when it comes to actually investing in
cybersecurity professionals, things suddenly change. Salaries drop,
budgets shrink, and job descriptions ask for an impossible list of
skills --- often for the price of a junior developer.

Think about this: A company will gladly pay millions of dollars to a PR
agency after a data breach to clean up its reputation. But before the
breach? Suddenly, paying a cybersecurity expert a decent salary seems
like an unnecessary expense.

This mindset is not just frustrating --- it's dangerous.

### The Unpaid Internship Trap {#2c9a .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="2c9a"}

Another disturbing trend is the rise of unpaid cybersecurity
internships. Now, internships can be great learning experiences, but
let's be real: expecting highly skilled individuals to work for free
while protecting a company's valuable assets is absurd.

Would a hospital ask an unpaid intern to perform surgery?

Would an airline let an unpaid intern fly a plane?

Of course not. So why do companies think it's okay to let unpaid interns
handle cybersecurity?

Many businesses view cybersecurity as a 'cost center' --- an unavoidable
expense rather than a necessity. They forget that security professionals
aren't just fixing things when they break. They are actively preventing
disasters. Without them, companies are leaving the door wide open for
cybercriminals.

### Paying the Ransom Instead {#e637 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="e637"}

Here's the irony: companies that refuse to pay for security talent often
end up paying cybercriminals instead.

Take ransomware attacks, for example. A business that skimps on
cybersecurity might save a few bucks in the short term, but the moment
ransomware locks down their systems, they'll be scrambling to pay the
attackers. The average ransom payment in 2024 has skyrocketed to
hundreds of thousands, sometimes even millions of dollars. And that's
just the ransom --- there are additional costs for recovery, legal fees,
and the inevitable damage to the company's reputation.

So let's pose a serious question: When ransomware attacks happen, will
companies offer the hackers an unpaid internship, too? Maybe they can
provide 'great learning opportunities' and unlimited chai ☕ while
negotiating the ransom?

Sounds ridiculous, right? But that's exactly what businesses do when
they refuse to invest in security professionals.

### The Cost of Ignoring Cybersecurity {#7a57 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="7a57"}

A company that ignores cybersecurity isn't just taking a risk --- it's
setting itself up for failure. Cyberattacks are no longer a matter of
'if' but 'when.' Let's look at some of the biggest consequences of not
investing in cybersecurity:

1.  [**Financial Losses:** The cost of a cyberattack can be devastating.
    A small business might never recover, and even large corporations
    suffer massive losses.]{#711d}
2.  [**Legal Consequences:** Data breaches often lead to lawsuits,
    regulatory fines, and compliance failures. In some cases, executives
    can even face criminal charges.]{#e6b2}
3.  [**Reputation Damage:** Customers lose trust in companies that can't
    protect their data. Once that trust is broken, it's incredibly
    difficult to rebuild.]{#d894}
4.  [**Operational Disruptions:** A ransomware attack can shut down a
    company's operations for days, weeks, or even months. The longer the
    downtime, the greater the losses.]{#2bdf}

### The Right Way Forward {#12b6 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="12b6"}

So, what's the solution? Companies need to stop treating cybersecurity
as an afterthought and start treating it as a critical business
function. Here's what needs to happen:

**Fair Salaries for Cybersecurity Professionals**

- [Security experts are in high demand. If companies don't offer
  competitive salaries, they'll lose talent to organizations that
  do.]{#7926}

**Proper Training and Development**

- [Instead of relying on unpaid interns, companies should invest in
  training programs and mentorship opportunities for entry-level
  security professionals.]{#b483}

**A Security-First Culture**

- [Cybersecurity isn't just an IT issue --- it's a company-wide
  responsibility. From the CEO to the newest employee, everyone should
  be educated on security best practices.]{#882c}

**Adequate Budget Allocation**

- [Companies need to allocate sufficient budgets for cybersecurity
  tools, risk assessments, and incident response plans. Cutting corners
  today will only lead to bigger expenses tomorrow.]{#5369}

### Final Thoughts {#19b5 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="19b5"}

Companies have two choices: Pay for cybersecurity now, or pay the ransom
later. There's no in-between. Investing in cybersecurity professionals
isn't just the right thing to do --- it's the smart thing to do.

If businesses continue to ignore security and expect professionals to
work for free, they're in for a rude awakening. Hackers don't work for
free. Neither should security experts.

So, what do you think? Should companies invest in cybersecurity or just
wait for a 'free lesson'?
