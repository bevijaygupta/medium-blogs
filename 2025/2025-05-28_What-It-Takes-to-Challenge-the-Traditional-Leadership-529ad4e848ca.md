When you think about leadership in the corporate world, certain
archetypes come to mind. There's the assertive CEO, the numbers-focused
CFO, and the growth-obsessed CMO. These roles have long stood as the
pillars of executive leadership. But what happens when someone enters
the C-suite not to chase profits, but to champion learning, well-being,
ethics, or sustainability?

Welcome to the new frontier of leadership --- where titles like Chief
Learning Officer (CLO), Chief People Officer (CPO), and Chief
Sustainability Officer (CSO) are redefining what it means to lead. These
roles come with an explicit commitment to values that go beyond the
bottom line. Yet, despite their executive status, many of these leaders
find themselves at the margins of traditional power structures.

In this blog, we'll explore what it really takes to challenge the
traditional leadership template and why the rise of these so-called
"marginal" leaders could be the most transformative shift in corporate
leadership in decades.

### The Traditional Leadership: A Quick Recap {#9dda .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="9dda"}

For decades, the corporate leadership model has been centered around a
few core roles that focus primarily on financial performance and
shareholder value. This model has rewarded traits like assertiveness,
decisiveness, and short-term results. Departments like HR, learning, and
sustainability have often been seen as support functions --- important,
yes, but not core to the "business" of business.

Leadership in this context has often been defined by control, hierarchy,
and a narrow focus on economic metrics. It's not surprising, then, that
roles like CLO or CSO were historically absent from many executive
teams. Their missions --- to foster learning, inclusivity, or
sustainability --- were often considered secondary or even expendable in
times of economic pressure.

But the world has changed, and with it, the definition of what good
leadership looks like.

### Enter the "Marginal" Leader {#979d .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="979d"}

Today's CLOs, CPOs, and CSOs are stepping into the C-suite with a very
different mandate. Their work touches everything from employee mental
health to environmental impact to social justice. They are not just
managing processes; they are leading cultural transformations.

However, entering these spaces doesn't mean these leaders are
automatically granted the same power or influence as their more
traditional counterparts. In fact, research suggests they are often seen
as both "marginal" and "leaders" simultaneously --- a paradox that
defines much of their experience.

Being marginal in this context doesn't mean irrelevant. It means
existing outside the dominant norms and power structures. It means
advocating for change in a system that often resists it. And that's no
small task.

### The Challenges They Face {#76dd .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="76dd"}

1.  [**Legitimacy and Credibility:** Many CLOs or CSOs find themselves
    constantly needing to justify their existence. Unlike
    revenue-generating roles, the value they bring is often indirect and
    long-term. This can make it harder to demonstrate ROI and gain the
    trust of more traditional leaders.]{#5bc9}
2.  [**Access to Resources:** Budgets for learning, wellness, or
    sustainability initiatives are often the first to be cut. Marginal
    leaders may struggle to secure the funding and support they need to
    make meaningful changes.]{#003f}
3.  [**Cultural Resistance:** Even when senior leadership is supportive,
    middle management may resist new initiatives, especially if they
    challenge long-standing norms or require significant behavioral
    change.]{#9d54}
4.  [**Isolation:** Being the only voice advocating for diversity or
    climate action in a room full of executives focused on quarterly
    earnings can be incredibly isolating.]{#e637}
5.  [**Misunderstanding of Role:** Many in the
    organization --- including peers in the C-suite --- may not fully
    understand what these roles entail, leading to underutilization or
    misalignment.]{#96e7}

### So, What Does It Take to Lead From the Margins? {#e15e .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="e15e"}

Challenging the traditional leadership requires more than just a title.
It takes resilience, creativity, and a deep sense of purpose. Here's how
these leaders are defining their place and purpose in novel ways:

1.  [**Reframing Success:** Marginal leaders are helping organizations
    broaden their definition of success. Instead of focusing solely on
    profits, they advocate for metrics that include employee engagement,
    social impact, and environmental responsibility.]{#1ea3}
2.  [**Storytelling and Data:** They are becoming masters at combining
    storytelling with hard data to make compelling cases for their
    initiatives. By linking values-based goals to business outcomes,
    they gain credibility and support.]{#9bf6}
3.  [**Coalition Building:** These leaders rarely work alone. They build
    coalitions across departments, aligning with allies who can help
    amplify their voice and extend their reach.]{#7dd9}
4.  [**Embedding Values Into Strategy:** The most effective marginal
    leaders don't treat their goals as side projects. Instead, they
    embed ethics, learning, or sustainability into the core business
    strategy.]{#6bc2}
5.  [**Modeling Inclusive Leadership:** They lead by example, showing
    what inclusive, ethical, and values-based leadership looks like. In
    doing so, they inspire others to lead differently.]{#5655}
6.  [**Resisting Tokenism:** Many marginal leaders must constantly
    resist being used as symbolic figures. They push for real influence
    and structural change, not just representation.]{#df8e}

### Real-World Examples of Marginal Leadership {#33dc .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="33dc"}

- [**Leena Nair**, former Chief Human Resources Officer at Unilever and
  now CEO of Chanel, used her role to champion diversity and well-being,
  proving that people-centric leadership can exist at the highest
  level.]{#6a4e}
- [**Mary Barra**, CEO of General Motors, prioritized sustainability and
  workplace culture, setting ambitious goals for electric vehicles and
  diversity.]{#9a11}
- [**Lisa Jackson**, Apple's Vice President of Environment, Policy and
  Social Initiatives, has redefined how a tech giant approaches
  sustainability and social responsibility.]{#aaab}

These leaders didn't just adapt to the traditional leadership
template --- they rewrote it.

### The Bigger Picture: Why This Matters Now {#3153 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="3153"}

In today's volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) world, the
traits that once defined great leaders are no longer sufficient. We need
leaders who can navigate complexity with empathy, who value long-term
sustainability over short-term gains, and who understand that businesses
are deeply embedded in social and environmental systems.

Marginal leaders are uniquely positioned to meet this moment. Their work
addresses some of the most pressing issues of our time: climate change,
inequality, mental health, and lifelong learning. Ignoring them --- or
relegating them to the sidelines --- is not just shortsighted; it's
dangerous.

### Toward a New Leadership Paradigm {#db38 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="db38"}

The rise of marginal leaders signals a profound shift in how we
understand leadership. It's a move away from command-and-control models
toward more inclusive, participatory, and values-driven approaches. It's
about integrating heart and mind, purpose and performance.

But for this shift to fully take root, organizations must do more than
hire CLOs and CSOs. They must empower them. They must listen to them.
They must integrate their perspectives into every facet of
decision-making.

Only then can we say we've truly challenged the traditional leadership
template.

### Final Thoughts {#211f .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="211f"}

Leadership is evolving --- and for good reason. The challenges we face
today require a broader, more inclusive, and more human-centered
approach to leadership. Marginal leaders are not just a trend; they are
the future.

So if you're a leader --- or aspire to be one --- ask yourself: Are you
clinging to the traditional template, or are you ready to redefine what
it means to lead?

Because the future of leadership isn't at the center. It's at the
margins --- and it's time we paid attention.
