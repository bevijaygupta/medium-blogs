**6:45 AM --- Alarm Rings**\
 My phone alarm goes off. It's a classic hacker ringtone --- ominous
binary beeps that make me feel like I'm about to launch a DDoS attack
from a submarine. I swipe it off and mumble, "Time to hack the planet."

Reality check: I trip over the charging cable and stub my toe on the
corner of my desk. Hacker life: 0, Furniture: 1.

**7:00 AM --- Hacker Fuel (a.k.a Coffee)**\
 Like every elite cyber-warrior wannabe, I start my day with two things:
caffeine and delusion. I brew my instant coffee, sit in front of my
dusty laptop, and whisper sweet nothings to it: "Let's break the
Internet today, baby."

I open Twitter. Some guy tweeted, *"Just hacked NASA using Notepad."*\
 I nod in approval. "Same, bro. Just didn't feel like saving Earth
today."

**7:30 AM --- Watching** [**Hacking
Tutorials**](https://einitial24.com/ethical-hacking-course/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://einitial24.com/ethical-hacking-course/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} **on YouTube**\
 I type: *"How to hack Wi-Fi password using CMD 100% working 2025"*.

The top video has a kid who looks like he's still doing algebra. He's
typing `ipconfig`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} and then pasting a
suspiciously long Python script. I try to follow along but get
distracted by a sidebar video: "Top 10 hackers caught red-handed." I
click it and think, "Note to self: don't use your real name as your
hacker alias."

**8:15 AM --- Installing Kali Linux (Again)**\
 For the fifth time this month, I try installing Kali Linux on
VirtualBox. I'm a *professional re-installer*. My VM crashes because I
gave it 512MB RAM and expected it to crack passwords like Mr. Robot.

I message my friend who's into tech:

> *Me: "Bro, what's the best Linux for hacking?"\
>  Him: "The one you actually learn to use."\
>  Me: "So Windows?"\
>  Him: "...please stop."*

**9:00 AM --- First Hack of the Day (My Own Instagram Password)**\
 I forgot my Instagram password again. I spend 20 minutes doing an
"ethical hack" on myself using the *forgot password* button. Mission
success. I'm now following 27 new "cybersecurity influencers" with names
like `cyberlord420`{.markup--code .markup--p-code}.

One of them posts: *"Hacking is an art. But don't draw on yourself."*
Deep. I write that on a sticky note and feel like Sun Tzu of CyberSec.

**10:00 AM --- Trying to Use Burp Suite**\
 Today, I shall master Burp Suite.

I download it, launch it, and immediately regret it. The interface looks
like the cockpit of a spaceship. I randomly click things until I
intercept a request. For 0.5 seconds, I feel powerful.

Then I accidentally block my own Google search.

Well, I guess this is how hackers learn. By breaking their own access to
cat memes.

**11:00 AM --- Following a Bug Bounty Walkthrough**\
 I start watching a walkthrough on finding XSS in a login page. The
hacker in the video types code faster than I can blink. I pause every 5
seconds, rewind every 3, and still can't find where the payload goes.

I try his exact payload. The website throws a 500 error.

Me: "Maybe it's because I used Edge instead of Firefox."

Switch browsers. Still error. I copy-paste it wrong this time and
accidentally shut down my tab.

At this point, the only thing I've exploited is my own patience.

**12:30 PM --- Lunch and Existential Crisis**\
 Eat Maggi noodles. Stare at ceiling. Wonder if Kevin Mitnick had days
like this.

Ask myself deep questions:

- [Am I cut out for this?]{#d305}
- [Will I ever hack a real website?]{#346e}
- [Why did I sign up for 3 Udemy courses I haven't opened yet?]{#e0b4}

My friend calls: "Yo, you coming for CS:GO later?"\
 Me: "Can't. Busy hacking."\
 Reality: I'm Googling *"is it illegal to try SQL injection on your own
WordPress blog."*

**2:00 PM --- Attempting an SQL Injection (On My Own Login Page)**\
 Today, I built a login page in PHP. It has no security, because that's
the only way I can actually make my "hacks" work.

I type:

``` {#7b77 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p .graf--preV2 code-block-mode="1" spellcheck="false" code-block-lang="bash"}
' OR '1'='1
```

Boom. Access granted.

I raise my hands in the air like I just hacked the Pentagon. Take a
screenshot and send it to my hacker group chat.

One guy replies: "Nice. But maybe use prepared statements next time."

I reply: "Maybe *you* use prepared statements. I'm busy being a legend."

**3:30 PM --- Reading Hacker News, Feeling Like an Impostor**\
 I read Hacker News. Some 17-year-old just found an RCE in a
billion-dollar company. Another guy built a Python tool to scan the dark
web for ransomware campaigns.

Meanwhile, I'm here trying to figure out why my Python script throws an
indentation error every time I hit "Tab."

I decide I need a break.

**4:00 PM --- Watching Mr. Robot (Again)**\
 Nothing inspires me like watching Elliot destroy E Corp with a hoodie
and a USB drive. I watch one episode and immediately open Notepad to
write:

``` {#d2a4 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p .graf--preV2 code-block-mode="1" spellcheck="false" code-block-lang="cpp"}
// future evil hack plan
1. Build botnet
2. Profit
```

Unfortunately, I don't know how to build a botnet. Or profit. Or code.

But I *do* have a cool hoodie, so that's a start.

**5:30 PM --- Random Google Search Deep Dive**\
 Somehow, I go from Googling "How to use Shodan" to "Can pigeons be
trained to sniff Wi-Fi?" and now I'm watching a 40-minute documentary on
cybercrime in North Korea.

I justify it as *research*. This is the hacker's way. Knowledge is
power. And I now know that pigeons cannot, in fact, sniff Wi-Fi.
Disappointing.

**6:30 PM --- Trying Nmap (AKA Pressing Enter and Hoping Something Cool
Happens)**\
 I run Nmap on my router.

``` {#c743 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p .graf--preV2 code-block-mode="1" spellcheck="false" code-block-lang="css"}
nmap -A 192.168.0.1
```

Terminal explodes with ports, services, and things I don't understand. I
screenshot it and post on Reddit.

Some guy comments: "Congrats, you scanned your fridge."

Turns out my smart fridge has port 80 open. That explains why it keeps
tweeting about milk.

**7:30 PM --- Dinner and Identity Crisis (Again)**\
 I eat while questioning everything.

- [Am I learning fast enough?]{#43c6}
- [Will I ever be good enough to get a real bounty?]{#5953}
- [Why did I spend \$300 on a Hack The Box subscription when I can't
  even hack the login page?]{#8eac}

I scroll through LinkedIn. See a post: "Landed my first bug
bounty --- \$1500!"\
 Me: eats rice sadly and stares at the wall.

**9:00 PM --- Getting Motivated Again**\
 Watch 3 motivational YouTube videos. Read Reddit threads of people who
started from zero. See someone who was a janitor last year and now works
at Google as a red teamer.

"Wow," I whisper. "I too mop... my keyboard."

Feeling recharged. Time to learn buffer overflows.

**9:30 PM --- Realize Buffer Overflows Require C Programming**\
 Open C tutorial. Confused by `int main()`{.markup--code
.markup--p-code} and curly braces.

Close it. Decide I'll just become a social engineer instead. I've been
manipulating my parents for snacks for years. Time to monetize it.

**10:30 PM --- Creating a Hacker Alias**\
 All great hackers have cool names.

Brainstorming ideas:

- [ZeroCool (taken)]{#42ad}
- [HackMeIfYouCan (cringe)]{#b96c}
- [CmdFreak (available!)]{#e8c0}
- [IP_Freely (oh god no)]{#92cb}
- [RootButCute (hmm...)]{#0f71}

I settle on `NoobSec_404`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} and create a
Twitter account. I follow a bunch of hackers and post: "Just getting
started. Let's hack something. #bugbounty #cybersec."

No likes. Perfect start.

**11:00 PM --- Learning One Real Thing**\
 I finally read a proper blog on XSS. Learn about
`<script>alert(1)</script>`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} and how it
can be used to pop an alert. Try it on a demo site. It works.

I cheer. "I am unstoppable!"

Until I try it on another site and get blocked by a WAF. Okay, not
*unstoppable*. Just *occasionally successful*.

Still, I write in my journal:

> *"Day 37: Successfully popped an alert. World domination soon."*

**12:00 AM --- Sleep, Dreaming of Hacktivity**\
 As I drift to sleep, I imagine my HackerOne profile filled with
bounties. I dream of DEF CON talks, black hoodies, and someone asking
me, "Are you that guy who found the 0-day in Apple?" and me replying
humbly, "Yes, but I'm just a guy with a keyboard."

In reality, I wake up because my VM crashed again. And I forgot to save
my notes.

### Final Thoughts {#2c07 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="2c07"}

Being a *wannabe hacker* is a wild ride. It's 10% understanding, 90%
Googling. One day you're watching tutorials, the next you're
accidentally DDoSing your router.

But that's the fun of it. Hacking isn't just about skills --- it's about
persistence, curiosity, and being okay with feeling like an idiot 90% of
the time.

If you're like me --- somewhere between "absolute noob" and "mildly
dangerous with a browser extension" --- then remember: **every pro
hacker was a noob once.**

So, drink your coffee, fire up your VM, and go hack yourself (ethically,
please).\
 Because this journey might be chaotic, slow, and hilarious --- but
damn, it's worth it.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to go... I think I just locked myself
out of my own CTF challenge.
