Oh man, that story is peak cyber-drama. 😂 Nothing screams \"run for the
hills\" like someone saying \"don\'t worry about the details, just hack
the firewall real quick.\" That's not a favor, that's the origin story
for a Netflix documentary.

Also, the moment when non-tech friends see a terminal and suddenly think
you\'re in Mr. Robot? Classic. Meanwhile, you're just there like:

\"Relax, I'm literally checking if my IP lease is still valid, not
launching nukes.\"

And props for walking away from that sketchy Scar situation---because
once the villain soundtrack starts playing in your head, it's time to
dip. 🏃‍♂️💨

Also, welcome to the world of TryHackMe! You're doing it right:
learning, flexing a little, and not going to cyber jail. That\'s the
sweet spot. 😄
