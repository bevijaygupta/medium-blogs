**Let's talk about the digital version of hiding your house key under
the doormat --- the infamous, the legendary, the monumentally awful...
*123456*.**

You'd think that in 2025, with AI writing novels, robots making pizza,
and everyone having at least *three* streaming subscriptions, we'd have
evolved past the world's worst password.

But nope.

'123456' is still alive and well, being proudly used by millions. It's
the cockroach of the password world. It survives, thrives, and terrifies
cybersecurity experts everywhere.

So... **why?** Let's unpack this digital disaster --- with a generous
sprinkle of sarcasm, relatable rants, and a little tech wisdom.

### 1. Because People Think "Hackers" Are Just in the Movies {#0711 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="0711"}

Let's be honest. Most people imagine hackers as hoodie-wearing,
caffeine-powered basement dwellers typing furiously in green code while
dramatic music plays in the background.\
 Spoiler: hackers don't need drama when your password is *literally 6
numbers in a row*.

Real-life hackers don't need fancy tricks. They just try "123456"
and --- boom --- they're in your email, reading that awkward message you
sent your boss instead of your therapist.

**Moral of the story:** real hackers love lazy passwords. You're
practically gift-wrapping your data.

### 2. Because Remembering Passwords is Harder Than Remembering Your Cousin's Birthday {#dfb5 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="dfb5"}

We've all been there. You sign up for yet another app --- probably one
that promises to make your life "10x more productive" --- and you're hit
with that *Create a password* prompt.

And you think, "Ugh, I already have 47 passwords, I'll just go with
something easy this time... I'll change it later."

**Narrator:** *They did not change it later.*

Then it becomes your password for everything: Gmail, Netflix, online
banking, your smart fridge.\
 If someone hacks you, they'll not only steal your money but also mess
with your thermostat for fun.

### 3. Because "Password123" Felt Too Complicated {#ade1 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="ade1"}

Let's be real. Adding "password" to a password is like hiding your spare
key under a rock that says "NOT A KEY UNDER HERE."

<figure id="168c" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p">
<img
src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*GHxWQyAWJKzOQwKf.jpg"
class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*GHxWQyAWJKzOQwKf.jpg"
data-width="1920" data-height="1080" />
</figure>

People *know* they're being basic. But they also think, "Who'd ever
guess that? It's too obvious!"

Exactly.

It's so obvious, it becomes invisible... like your common sense while
setting that password.

### 4. Because Nobody Cares Until They're Hacked {#1407 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="1407"}

Here's the universal truth about cybersecurity:\
 People care about it *after* their cousin calls saying, "Bro, why did
you send me a link to buy cheap sunglasses at 3 a.m.?"

That's when the panic sets in.

Suddenly they're googling "how to make strong passwords," downloading
VPNs, and yelling at their toaster, just in case it's listening.

But by then, their Netflix queue has been rearranged, their email is
sending spam, and some hacker in Belarus is ordering pizza on their
UberEats account.

**Don't be that person.**

### 5. Because Websites Still Let You Do It {#94a5 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="94a5"}

You know who the real enablers are?\
 Websites that say:\
 ✔ Password must be at least 6 characters\
 ✔ No special characters required\
 ✔ You do you, we don't care

**Result?**\
 People type '123456', the website gives a gentle green checkmark, and
the user thinks, "Perfect. Cybersecurity: mastered."

We need tougher love. Give us warning signs. Red alerts. Maybe even a
message that says:

> *"Seriously? You're going with* that*?"*

### 6. Because No One Told Grandma {#a491 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="a491"}

Let's not forget our beloved boomers and the digitally-challenged.

If your mom, grandpa, or sweet old aunt still uses '123456', it's not
always their fault.\
 They didn't grow up with "2FA," "phishing scams," or the concept that
your fridge might get hacked.

So they go with what's easy. And then they wonder why their Facebook got
taken over by someone selling crypto courses.

Help them. Educate them. Or at least set them up with a password manager
that doesn't require a 10-page manual.

### 7. Because People Still Think, "It Won't Happen to Me" {#36b9 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="36b9"}

Ah yes, the classic *main character syndrome*.

"Sure, people get hacked, but *not me*. I'm just a regular person. Why
would anyone want my data?"

Oh, my sweet summer child.

**You're exactly who they want.**\
 Hackers don't care if you're a famous influencer or a guy who
binge-watches cooking shows at 2 AM. Your email, your data, your
identity --- all have value.

To a hacker, everyone is a buffet. And your weak password is basically
free dessert.

### So... What's The Fix? {#8b4b .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="8b4b"}

**Use strong, unique passwords**. Not your birthday. Not your pet's
name. Not "123456" or any variation of "password."\
 Use a *password manager* if your brain refuses to cooperate.

Or try this formula:

- [Pick a random sentence like "My cat drinks coffee at 6am!"]{#e200}
- [Take the first letter of each word: `Mcdca6a!`{.markup--code
  .markup--li-code}]{#1e50}
- [BAM! You've got a strong, weird, memorable password.]{#451f}

(Just don't use that exact one now --- we're watching you.)

### Final Thoughts: Don't Be a Digital Caveman {#37be .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="37be"}

We get it. Tech is overwhelming. Passwords are annoying. But '123456' is
not just bad --- it's laughably bad.

If your password looks like a toddler just slammed their hand on the
number pad, it's time to upgrade.

**Protect your accounts like you protect your pizza --- fiercely and
with zero room for sharing.**

Now go forth, change your password, and help a friend do the same.\
 And if you're still using '123456' after reading this... well, we'll
keep you in our thoughts and (very secure) prayers.
