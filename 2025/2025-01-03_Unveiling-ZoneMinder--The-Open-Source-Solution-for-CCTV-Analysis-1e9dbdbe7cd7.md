In an age where technology continues to redefine surveillance and
security, finding an economical yet powerful solution for video
surveillance is a priority for many. While exploring CCTV analysis
software, I stumbled upon ZoneMinder, an intriguing open-source platform
designed for monitoring, recording, and analyzing camera feeds.

there's a catch: ZoneMinder is predominantly tailored to Linux-based
environments, such as Ubuntu and CentOS, and lacks native support for
Windows. Despite this, its versatility and robust feature set make it a
standout solution for a wide range of applications, from small-scale
residential setups to large enterprise-grade deployments.
