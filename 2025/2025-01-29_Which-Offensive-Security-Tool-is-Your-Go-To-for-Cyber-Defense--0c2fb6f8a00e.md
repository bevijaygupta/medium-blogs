### Introduction {#8f3e .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--figure name="8f3e"}

Cybersecurity is a never-ending arms race between attackers and
defenders. To protect systems effectively, security professionals often
use the same tools as cybercriminals --- but for ethical purposes. These
offensive security tools help ethical hackers and security analysts
simulate real-world attacks, find vulnerabilities, and strengthen cyber
defenses. But with so many options available, which one is your go-to
tool for cyber defense?

In this blog, we'll explore some of the best offensive security tools
that cybersecurity professionals rely on to test and fortify networks.
Whether you're a penetration tester, red teamer, or blue team defender,
you'll likely find something that fits your needs.

### 1. Metasploit Framework {#9b04 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="9b04"}

**Why It's Popular:** Metasploit is arguably the most famous penetration
testing framework. It provides an extensive library of exploits,
