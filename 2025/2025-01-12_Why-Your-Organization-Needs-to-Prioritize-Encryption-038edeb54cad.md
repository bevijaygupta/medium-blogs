In today's interconnected world, where data flows seamlessly across
borders and devices, securing sensitive information has become more
crucial than ever. Encryption, the process of encoding data to prevent
unauthorized access, stands at the forefront of data protection
strategies. Yet, many organizations still view encryption as an optional
safeguard rather than an essential component of their cybersecurity
framework. This blog will delve into why your organization must
prioritize encryption, its benefits, and how to effectively implement
it.

### Understanding Encryption {#74aa .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="74aa"}

At its core, encryption transforms readable data (plaintext) into an
unreadable format (ciphertext) using cryptographic algorithms and keys.
Only authorized parties with the correct decryption key can revert the
ciphertext to its original form. Encryption is widely used for securing:

- [**Data at Rest:** Stored data on devices, servers, or
  databases.]{#623c}
- [**Data in Transit:** Information being transmitted over
  networks.]{#49d6}

Common encryption algorithms include Advanced Encryption Standard (AES),
Rivest--Shamir--Adleman (RSA), and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).
