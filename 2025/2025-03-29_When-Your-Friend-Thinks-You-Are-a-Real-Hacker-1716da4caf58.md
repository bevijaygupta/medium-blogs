### **When Your Friend Thinks You Are a Real Hacker** {#7abd .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading .graf--title name="7abd"}

If you have ever dabbled in cybersecurity, programming, or even just
used a terminal in front of a non-tech friend, you've probably
experienced this moment. The expectation versus reality of hacking is
often wildly different, thanks to Hollywood and pop culture.

Picture this: You're sitting at your desk, peacefully minding your own
business, when your friend leans in with that look in their eyes. The
one that says, "I have a ridiculous request, but I think you're actually
capable of it."

"Bro, can you hack into my school's grading system and change my math
grade?"

*Sigh.* Here we go again.

### The Terminal of Disappointment {#d0da .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="d0da"}

data-height="1294" />
</figure>

So, let's set the scene. You decide to mess with them a little.

You open the terminal with a dramatic flourish.

You type:

``` {#ef12 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p .graf--preV2 code-block-mode="1" spellcheck="false" code-block-lang="sql"}
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

The screen floods with text, scrolling like The Matrix. Green,
fast-moving, completely incomprehensible to them. Their eyes widen in
excitement.

Friend (whispering): "Bro... are you in?"

You pause for dramatic effect. Look at them. Look at the screen.

"Yes... into a never-ending cycle of software updates."

The expression on their face changes from awe to confusion. The
realization sets in. They expected frantic typing, bypassing firewalls,
and decrypting secret government files, but instead, they got... patch
management.

Welcome to real cybersecurity.

### The Reality of Ethical Hacking {#7d42 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="7d42"}

The truth is, hacking is nothing like the movies. Real cybersecurity
work is:

- [**90% patience** (because things rarely work the first time)]{#3395}
- [**9% troubleshooting** (because things rarely work the second
  time)]{#7fd0}
- [**1% explaining to your friends why updating software is not hacking
  the mainframe**]{#e17f}

Cybersecurity is about securing systems, not breaking into them for fun.
But try explaining that to someone whose only exposure to hacking is
from *Mr. Robot* or *The Matrix*.

### The Funniest Tech Misconceptions I've Heard {#3fde .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="3fde"}

Here are some real-life scenarios that anyone in tech has probably
faced:

#### 1. The "Can You Hack Their Instagram for Me?" Request {#c1de .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="c1de"}

One of my friends, let's call him Raj, once asked me, "Hey, you do
cybersecurity, right? Can you hack into my ex's Instagram?"

I blinked at him. "No, Raj, that's illegal."

He shrugged, as if it was a casual favor, like lending him a charger.
"Come on, bro. Just a little hack."

I then explained how hacking someone's social media account is literally
a **criminal offense**, and he could face serious consequences. His
response?

"Okay, fine. But, like, what if I just *accidentally* guess her
password?"

Facepalm.

#### 2. The "Just Hack the Wi-Fi" Trick {#17f5 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="17f5"}

Another classic request is the infamous "Can you hack the Wi-Fi?" One
time at a coffee shop, a friend nudged me and whispered, "Dude, hack the
Wi-Fi so we don't have to pay for it."

I pulled out my phone, connected to my mobile hotspot, and said, "Boom.
Hacked."

His eyes lit up. "Wait, for real?"

"Yes, I hacked into *my own* network."

He wasn't pleased.

#### 3. The "Green Text Means Hacking" Myth {#bb94 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="bb94"}

One of the biggest misconceptions is that **green text on a black
background = hacking.**

One time, I was writing a simple Python script while my friend watched.
I had a terminal open, running some basic commands.

Them: "Damn, that looks sick. Are you hacking?"

Me: "No, I'm just renaming files."

Them: "But... the text is green."

Apparently, that was enough to convince them I was some sort of
underground cyber vigilante.

### The Reality of Ethical Hacking {#624d .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="624d"}

To be fair, hacking *can* be exciting. [Ethical
hacking](https://einitial24.com/ethical-hacking-course/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://einitial24.com/ethical-hacking-course/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, or penetration testing, is all about
finding vulnerabilities in a system before the bad guys do. It requires
a deep understanding of networking, coding, system administration, and
security tools. But it's nowhere near as dramatic as Hollywood makes it
seem.

Here's what real cybersecurity looks like:

- [**Updating software regularly** (because unpatched software is a
  hacker's playground)]{#7145}
- [**Checking logs** (yes, reading through endless system logs to find
  anomalies)]{#4255}
- [**Using tools like Wireshark and Metasploit** (but in a legal and
  controlled environment)]{#e3e9}
- [**Writing reports** (because every ethical hacker's job involves
  documenting vulnerabilities and suggesting fixes)]{#c89b}
- [**Explaining to non-tech friends that hacking is not magic**]{#b38f}

### Have You Ever Had a Friend Ask You to Hack Something Ridiculous? {#533e .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="533e"}

If you work in tech, especially cybersecurity, you've probably had
friends, relatives, or even complete strangers ask you to "hack"
something absurd.

Maybe they wanted free Netflix. Maybe they thought you could "erase
their student loans" by pressing a few keys. Maybe they just assumed you
could type **random code** into the terminal and suddenly gain control
over the **government's secret database.**

So, what's the funniest tech misconception you've ever heard? Drop it in
the comments --- I'd love to hear it!
