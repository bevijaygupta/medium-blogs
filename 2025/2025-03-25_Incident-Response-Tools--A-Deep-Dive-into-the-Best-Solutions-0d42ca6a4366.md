### Introduction to Incident Response {#96f9 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--figure name="96f9"}

In today's digital landscape, cybersecurity threats are more
sophisticated than ever. Organizations face a constant barrage of
cyberattacks, ranging from phishing and malware infections to data
breaches and insider threats. Incident response (IR) is a critical
component of a strong cybersecurity strategy, ensuring that security
teams can detect, analyze, contain, and remediate threats effectively.

Incident response involves structured methodologies to handle security
incidents and minimize damage. A robust incident response plan (IRP)
includes preparation, detection, analysis, containment, eradication, and
recovery. However, manual IR efforts are insufficient against modern
threats. This is where **incident response tools** come into play,
providing automation, threat intelligence, and real-time visibility to
security teams.

In this article, we will explore some of the most effective incident
response tools available today, including:
