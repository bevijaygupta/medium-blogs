LMAO yesss, I feel you 100%! 😂 The moment you mention "cybersecurity,"
suddenly everyone thinks you've got Matrix-level skills like \"Yo, can
you hack into my ex's Instagram real quick?\"

Bruh... I just figured out what TCP/IP stands for, chill. 😭

And facts --- integrity always comes first. Just 'cause we learning the
tools doesn't mean we're out here turning into cyber-criminals. We\'re
tryna build firewalls, not break through \'em. 🛑🔥

Appreciate the love, fam. We really out here studying and dodging
sketchy "favors" like it's a side quest. 💯
