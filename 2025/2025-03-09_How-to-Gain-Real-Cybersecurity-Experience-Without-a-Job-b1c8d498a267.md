### Everyone in Cybersecurity Wants "Experience," But No One Tells You How to Get It {#0bb0 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--figure name="0bb0"}

One of the biggest challenges in
[cybersecurity](https://vijaykumargupta.in/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://vijaykumargupta.in/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank"} is breaking into the industry without prior experience.
You keep hearing the same advice over and over again: *"Just do
projects, bro."* 🤦‍♂️ But what does that even mean?

The truth is, most beginners work on random projects that don't actually
help them build skills that are valuable in the industry. Sure, you
might have set up a SIEM or deployed a honeypot, but do you actually
*know* how to use them effectively? Do they align with real-world
cybersecurity job roles?

If you want to stand out and actually get hired, you need to focus on
projects that align with the **five major** [**cybersecurity
areas**](https://vijaykumargupta.in/category/cybersecurity/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://vijaykumargupta.in/category/cybersecurity/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} that are in high demand right now.
Below, I'll break down these key areas and provide **practical, hands-on
projects** you can work on today to build experience that actually
matters.

### 1️⃣ SOC Analyst / Blue Teaming {#e528 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="e528"}

Security Operations Center (SOC) Analysts are the first line of defense
in cybersecurity. They monitor networks, detect threats, and respond to
incidents. If you want to become a SOC Analyst, working on relevant
projects is crucial.

### Hands-On Projects: {#576b .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="576b"}

### 2️⃣ Network Traffic Analysis & Active Directory Security {#f271 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="f271"}

If you're interested in **network security or Active Directory (AD)
security**, you need to know how to analyze network traffic, detect
anomalies, and secure enterprise environments.

[cybersecurity](https://vijaykumargupta.in/the-essential-cybersecurity-tools-you-must-know/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://vijaykumargupta.in/the-essential-cybersecurity-tools-you-must-know/"

### Bonus: How to Add These Projects to Your Resume {#7439 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="7439"}

A common mistake beginners make is listing projects in a vague way on
their resume. Instead of saying: ❌ *"Built a SIEM"*

You should say: ✅ *"Configured and monitored a SIEM using Splunk,
investigated and responded to security alerts, and wrote detection rules
to identify suspicious activity."*
