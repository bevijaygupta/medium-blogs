Let's be honest for a second. When I first heard people saying they were
making real money on *Medium*, I laughed it off. "Maybe a few dollars,"
I thought. "No way \$100 a day." Fast forward to today, and here I am,
sipping my mediocre homemade coffee, while Medium literally pays for my
rent, groceries, and guilt-driven Amazon purchases.

In this blog, I'll walk you through my entire journey --- how I
*actually* make \$100/day consistently on Medium, what mistakes I made,
what worked, and how you can replicate it if you're serious. No fluff,
no gatekeeping. Just straight-up real talk, short paragraphs, and plenty
of awkward humor.

### Chapter 1: My Humble Beginnings (aka 'How I Sucked at Writing') {#5fe4 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="5fe4"}

I didn't have a journalism degree. Heck, I used to write like I was
texting my college crush --- way too many exclamation marks and zero
clarity. But I was curious. I loved reading stories on Medium,
especially around self-improvement, cybersecurity (my professional
background), startups, and weirdly specific productivity hacks.

I signed up for the **Medium Partner Program**, wrote my first post
titled "How I Survived Monday Without Crying," and earned a glorious
\$0.13.

Thirteen. Cents.

I laughed and almost gave up.

But something in me said, "Let's do one more." And that "one more"
turned into 367 articles (as of today), a growing fanbase, and
yes --- **over \$3,000 a month** from Medium alone.

### Chapter 2: Understanding the Game (It's Not Just Writing) {#6ff6 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="6ff6"}

Here's what I learned quickly: Medium isn't just a blogging
platform --- it's an ecosystem. And like any ecosystem, you need to
*understand its rules* to thrive.

Medium rewards **engagement**, not just views. That means:

- [People read your article *to the end*]{#fafb}
- [They click the little "clap" button like it owes them money]{#0396}
- [They highlight sentences and comment]{#39f5}
- [They **follow** you and come back for more]{#5ac9}

To make money, you need to focus on **Member Reading Time** --- how much
time paying Medium members spend reading your work. That's what drives
your earnings.

### Chapter 3: Niching Down Without Being Boring {#c730 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="c730"}

People always say, "Pick a niche."

Cool advice, but I had **multiple interests**: tech, productivity,
money, cybercrime stories, AI tools, and dark web myth-busting. Instead
of fighting it, I used it.

I created *buckets* of content:

1.  [**Cybersecurity for Normies**]{#37fe}
2.  [**Side Hustles That Don't Suck**]{#3ada}
3.  [**AI Tools That Make Me Lazy but Rich**]{#4208}
4.  [**Personal Rants with Life Lessons Hidden in Them**]{#b6c2}

Each piece fell into one of these categories. Readers started following
me for specific themes, and suddenly --- I had loyal fans who'd
binge-read my stuff like it was a Netflix series.

### Chapter 4: Quantity vs Quality (Why You Need Both) {#e43e .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="e43e"}

Let's get something clear: I did **not** go viral overnight. I published
4 articles a week for *4 months straight* before I saw my first article
earn more than \$20.

I treated writing like a job. Monday to Thursday = content days. Friday
= planning, editing, and engaging with others.

Most people give up because they write *3 pieces*, get *zero traction*,
and call it a day.

I was writing *15,000+ words* every week. Some sucked. Some were decent.
A few exploded.

But I never stopped showing up. Medium rewards consistency, especially
if you stay in your lane (or 2--3 related lanes).

### Chapter 5: Writing Hooks That Hooked Like Crack {#304f .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="304f"}

Your **headline and first 3 lines** matter more than the rest of your
article.

Yes, I said it.

If your hook is boring, no one reads. If no one reads, no one pays. If
no one pays, you end up back on your couch watching reruns of "Shark
Tank" wondering where your life went wrong.

Here's what worked for me:

### 🔥 Headline Formulas: {#573b .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="573b"}

- ["I Did \[Weird Thing\] for 30 Days --- Here's What Happened"]{#e297}
- ["The Brutal Truth About \[Something Trending\]"]{#c016}
- ["How I Made \$\_\_\_\_ with Only \[X\] Hours of Work"]{#73fb}
- ["If You're Doing This, You're Already Losing in Life"]{#3faf}

### 🔥 First Sentence Tips: {#e62b .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="e62b"}

- [Start with **a question** (that makes people think)]{#5abf}
- [Start with **a confession** (that makes you human)]{#17a7}
- [Start with **a controversial claim** (that makes them argue)]{#9f81}

Example?

"I got scammed on the dark web and it was my fault."

Boom. You'll want to know what happened, right?

### Chapter 6: Joining Medium Publications (The Real Gamechanger) {#1e07 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="1e07"}

Writing on your own profile is cute, but if you want *real reach*, you
need to **publish in big publications** on Medium.

Why?

Because they have **existing audiences**. People already trust them. And
when they publish your work, it's like getting a shoutout from a
YouTuber with 1M subs.

Here are a few that accepted me:

- [**Better Programming** (for my techy AI/cyber stuff)]{#e542}
- [**Mind Cafe** (for self-improvement)]{#3b20}
- [**Illumination** (for just about anything)]{#9212}
- [**Entrepreneur's Handbook** (money and startup stories)]{#9977}

I reached out with a short pitch and some samples. Once in, my articles
got *5x the views and 10x the reads*.

### Chapter 7: Writing for Medium's Algorithm (Without Selling Your Soul) {#adf0 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="adf0"}

Medium likes:\
 ✅ Personal storytelling\
 ✅ Emotion-driven writing\
 ✅ Useful takeaways\
 ✅ Short paragraphs (like this)\
 ✅ Clean formatting

Medium doesn't like:\
 ❌ Walls of text\
 ❌ Too much self-promo\
 ❌ Clickbait with no payoff\
 ❌ Copy-pasted ChatGPT content (don't be lazy)

Write like you're having coffee with a friend --- smart but chill.
Honest but helpful. Real but structured.

That's the vibe that converts **readers into fans**, and fans into
income.

### Chapter 8: How the Money Breaks Down {#623e .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="623e"}

I promised you numbers. So here we go:

Here's a real breakdown from a recent 7-day period:

- [**Cybersecurity Side Hustles** --- 1,400 views → \$86]{#d964}
- [**Dark Web Myths Debunked** --- 800 views → \$42]{#a4b0}
- [**How I Use AI for Passive Income** --- 1,200 views → \$67]{#b6c0}
- [**Productivity for Lazy Freelancers** --- 700 views → \$33]{#2463}

📈 **Total in one week**: \$228\
 📆 **That's over \$30/day**\
 ✅ Add in some old evergreen posts still earning → easily **\$100/day**

Medium pays based on how long *paying members* spend reading. So even a
post with "just 1,000 views" can earn \$50+ if people read the whole
thing and interact.

### Chapter 9: Repurposing for Maximum Impact {#4cc2 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="4cc2"}

Here's a secret: I *don't just write for Medium*.

- [Turn Medium posts into **LinkedIn carousels**]{#b886}
- [Convert articles into **YouTube scripts**]{#d054}
- [Offer extended versions as **mini eBooks**]{#2573}
- [Repackage them into **Notion templates** or digital freebies]{#fe19}

This way, one blog post turns into *4--5 pieces of content*, and Medium
becomes a launchpad for other income streams.

### Chapter 10: FAQs I Keep Getting (Let's Set the Record Straight) {#a4c9 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="a4c9"}

**"Is Medium dying?"**\
 No. It's evolving. Quality content still wins.

**"Can I earn if I live outside the U.S.?"**\
 Yup, as long as the Medium Partner Program is available in your country
(sadly, not India yet 😢).

**"Do I need to be a native English speaker?"**\
 Nope. Just be clear, honest, and useful. Use tools like Grammarly.
You're golden.

**"What if I hate writing?"**\
 Try audio transcription tools. Talk your article, then edit. Boom.

### Chapter 11: Tools I Use (My Holy Grail) {#9a25 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="9a25"}

Here's what helps me stay productive:

- [**Notion** --- For content calendar + idea bank]{#1360}
- [**Hemingway App** --- To make my writing crisp]{#37df}
- [**Canva** --- For creating visuals + headers]{#dcf1}
- [**ChatGPT** --- For brainstorming outlines and titles]{#2c75}
- [**Medium Stats Dashboard** --- To see what's working]{#e5e8}

### Final Words: You Can Totally Do This {#b9ae .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="b9ae"}

Look, if a guy who used to write clickbait college essays to impress his
crush can make \$100/day writing on Medium, **you definitely can too**.

The secret?

- [Write like a human]{#3855}
- [Share stuff that's helpful]{#91e6}
- [Be consistent]{#3ff6}
- [Don't chase viral --- chase *value*]{#80dd}

One good post can earn you income **for months or even years**. It
compounds. Just like investing. But with your thoughts.

So grab that coffee. Start that article. And clap for yourself (you'll
need practice for when readers do it for real 😉).
