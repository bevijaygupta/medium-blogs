Thanks so much for the kind words---I\'m really glad you enjoyed the
article! That photo does have a certain pull, doesn't it? It\'s funny
how the right image can draw people in.

Really appreciate you taking the time to comment, especially as a Medium
subscriber.

Your idea about an article on portable CD players is great. There\'s
definitely a need for a clear, practical guide, and I've got a lot of
love for the old Discmans too. Sony really nailed it back then.

I haven't written about that yet, but it's on my list now. Thanks again
for the support and the inspiration!
